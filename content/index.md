# TEST
A test is the central mechanic of rolling dice to resolve a situation by determining if there’s a successful outcome or a challenging failure. Almost always, tests are initiated by the GM asking the player, “What do you do?” If the outcome is guaranteed, a test can be resolved without rolling dice. The GM can declare that the test is an automatic success, or the player can choose not to respond to a test and find another way forward. Tests are usually uncomplicated. A success means the character does what they wanted to do, and a failure means they don’t.

See more in [[Tests]].

# DIFFICULTY
![[Difficulty]]

# CONTEST

A contest is a series of dice rolls between opponents, each trying to beat the previous roll until one side chooses not to roll and gives in, or fails to beat the previous roll and takes a complication or is taken out. When a PC gets into a conflict over something they want, a contest determines if any other character can intervene, thwart, or oppose the PC. Contests are almost always initiated by a player, who picks up dice and essentially says, “I’m doing this. Who’s stopping me?” If no one opposes the PC, there’s no need to roll dice—the contest’s outcome is determined as if the player succeeded. If an effect die is required, use the largest die in the initiating player’s dice pool.

See more in [[Contest]].

# DICE
Cortex Prime uses five kinds of dice: **d4**, **d6**, **d8**, **d10**, **d12**. The number indicates how many sides the die has: the more sides, the bigger the numbers. A handful of dice is called a dice pool. When a die is rolled, the number on the uppermost face is the result. Add results together to get a total. The dice introduce a random element to play, helping us resolve tests and contests. Bigger dice (more sides) means potentially better outcomes, and more dice means more reliable outcomes.

## DIE RATING
Every [[Trait]] in the game has a die rating. Whenever you use the [[Trait]], you pick up a die of that size for your dice pool. Die ratings usually correspond to how much effect that [[Trait]] has on the outcome of any given test or contest.

## ROLLING DICE
Usually when you roll two or more dice, you choose two results to add together for your total, and a third die to use as the [[Effect Die]]. This is a roll and keep method of resolving an outcome. If you’re rolling one die, your total is equal to the result of that die. If you don’t have a third die, your effect die starts at **d4**.

You are free to choose any two dice for your total. You don’t need to choose the two highest rolling dice. You may want to save a die with more sides for your effect die, even if it was the highest result. Likewise, the GM may decide to let the dice fall where they may and always keep the two highest rolling dice, or use the choice of two dice as a way to moderate the opposition without simply fudging dice.

See more about [[Dice]]

# EFFECT DIE
An effect die represents the impact of a success, and might be used in many different ways depending on the context. The effect die is chosen from the dice pool after the dice used for the total are taken out and added together. Usually the effect die is the largest size of die that wasn’t used in the total. Only the size of the effect die (number of sides) matters; the result rolled on the effect die has no further use in the roll.

## INELIGIBLE DICE
You can’t choose a die that produced a hitch for an effect die. If you spend [[Plot Points]] to add more dice to a total beyond the first two, those dice also can’t also be used as effect dice. If there are no dice left in the pool once the total is determined (or the remaining dice are hitches or otherwise spoken for), the effect die is always a **d4**.

See more about [[Effect Die]].

# HITCHES
![[Hitches]]

# PLOT POINTS
Cortex Prime games run on a narrative currency called plot points ([[Plot Point]]) that influence the plot. Plot points can be spent to give players more dice, make the dice they have more powerful, or activate certain traits or special effects (SFX) on a character file. 

The following are the standard ways to earn and spend [[Plot Point]] as a player.

### Earning
• Roll a hitch (a **1**) that the GM activates
• Give in during a contest
• Activate an SFX like Hinder
• Engage in remarkable moments of roleplaying
### Spending
• Activate SFX
• Add two dice from a [[Trait Sets]] instead of one
• Activate an Opportunity (a **1**) that the GM rolls
• Avoid being [[Taken Out]]
• Create a **d6** [[Assets]] for the scene, or to keep an [[Assets]] for the rest of the session
• Include an additional result in your total
• Interfere in a contest
• Keep an extra effect die
• Share an [[Assets]] with everyone in a scene

See more about [[Plot Points]]

# HEROIC SUCCESS
When you roll a truly spectacular total, you can achieve a heroic success.

In a [[Tests]] if you beat the difficulty by 5 or more on a roll, you’ve got a heroic success. You not only get what you want, your roll produces unexpected beneficial results. In a [[Contest]], if your opponent loses by 5 or more, you’ve got a heroic success and are the clear victor.

As with any success, the GM should ask you to describe your amazing efforts, but the effect die is also stepped up by one for every 5 points you beat the difficulty by.

See more about [[Heroic Success]]
## HERO DICE
The primary benefit of a heroic success is the creation of [[Hero Dice]]. On a [[heroic success]], you may bank a die equal to the highest rolling die in the 
opposing [[Dice Pool]]. These banked dice are called hero dice, and players may save as many of them as they like. There’s a space on the character file to indicate how many hero dice you’ve earned and what size they are.

To use a hero die, you spend a [[Plot Point]] and roll the die, adding it to your total in any [[Tests]] or [[Contest]]. You may do this at any time after rolling the dice to get a total, even if you rolled first and the opposition has already rolled their own dice.

Hero dice can backfire. If the die comes up 1—a [[Hitches]]— the GM may introduce a [[Complications]] as if you had rolled a 1 on any other die. However, instead of 
accepting a [[Plot Point]] from the GM, you may choose to take back your hero die and not add it to your total. You still lose the [[Plot Point]] you spent to activate it.

See more about [[Hero Dice]]

# HELPING OTHERS
PCs can aid one another in three ways.

They may spend a [[Plot Point]] to share an [[Assets]], or create a new [[Assets]] for another PC to use.

They may give another PC, one die of an appropriate [[Trait]] - albeit this means they can be the target of [[Complications]]/consequences.

Or they may step down one of your Value die ratings by one, in order to step up that same [[Values]] in their own [[Dice Pool]] for that roll. Your value remains stepped down until the end of the session.

See more about [[Helping Others]].

# TRAITS
Each PC’s [[Character File]] is mostly a list of [[traits]] and related game stats. [[Traits]] define a character and how they interact with the world they live in. They paint a picture of who a character is and what they can do, not just in terms of their skills and abilities but also their personality, background, or aspirations.

Almost all [[traits]] have die ratings, usually between **d4** and **d12**. When that trait comes into play, the player rolls that die as part of their [[Dice Pool]].

## TRAIT SETS
![[Trait Sets]]

## PRIME SET
A prime set is a set of traits that can be used in every role. For our game we are using [[Roles]], [[Values]], and [[Distinctions]].

Every Cortex Prime game needs at least two [[Prime Sets]] in addition to [[distinctions]]. These are the source of almost every [[Dice Pool]] used in [[tests]] and [[Contest]]. Games can have additional trait sets beyond their prime sets. These are not included in every [[Dice Pool]], only when they are relevant.

See more about [[Prime Sets]]

## TEMPORARY TRAITS
In play, characters may gain temporary traits, which last for a short time—a [[scene]], or maybe a session. Temporary traits can also be assigned directly to a [[scene]] or to a [[Location]], and either go away when circumstances make them irrelevant (like a Flaming Torch **d6** once it’s doused in a lake) or when some other time limit is reached. [[Assets]] and [[Complications]] are the most common examples of temporary traits.

## IN OUR GAME
We use the following [[Prime Sets]] traits in our game:

- [[Distinctions]]
- [[Values]]
- [[Roles]]

And we use the following Traits overall:

- [[Signature Assets]]
- [[Specialties]]

See more about [[Traits]]

# PLAYER
Each of the people playing the game, specifically the people who are not the game moderator (GM). Each player takes on the role of one player character, or PC.

Players are responsible for:
• Deciding what their PCs do.
• Confronting any problems that the GM throws in front of them.
• Pointing their PCs in directions that make for good stories.
• Supporting other PCs and giving them a shot at what they’re good at.
• Deciding how their PCs change and grow over time.
• In general, telling the story of their PCs.

Additionally, each player is responsible for helping ensure that the gaming experience is enjoyable for everyone. [[Consent]] should always be part of a group’s conversation about social standards at the table. See [[Consent]] for more.

See more about [[Player]]

# PLAYER CHARACTER FILE
A character file is the central record of essential game details for a character. All players maintain their own character file and the GM maintains (often abbreviated) files for important GMCs. Character files change throughout the game, so it’s important to be able to take notes on them.

A character file needs to include space for all of the information players need to record and maintain, such as the different [[Trait Sets]] and their ratings, plus maybe stress, [[session records]], [[Hero Dice]], [[Signature Assets]], and other important game statistics.

See more about [[Player Character|Player Characters]].

# # DISTINCTIONS
Distinctions are a trait that represents a character’s background, personality, and role in the game and that differentiates them from other PCs and GMCs.

To inspire roleplaying, PCs have three distinctions rated at **d8** that paint a clearer picture of their background, personality, and role in the story. Just by looking at your character’s three distinctions you should have a clear impression of who they are and how their past has shaped them. The choice of when to use a distinction is the player’s, but it must make narrative sense to do so.

Your distinctions should be varied and broad enough that one of them will apply almost every time you put together a [[Dice Pool]].

Distinctions are frequently paired up with [[SFX]]—in fact, all of them have the Hinder [[SFX]]: “Gain a [[Plot Point]] when you switch out this distinction’s die for a **d4**.”

See more about [[Distinctions]]

# GEAR
[[Gear]] may encompass armor, weapons, handy tools, and more. In our game, [[Gear]] can be narrative (that is, it has no dice or mechanical effects attached to it), or it can be [[Signature Assets]].

Additionally, if needed, [[Gear]] can have a Range (d8 if it's a stretch to hit, d12 if it's almost impossible, added to the opposition pool). Or may prevent or help some damage, in which case the rating of the armor gets stepped down (until the combat ends).

See more about [[Gear]]

# RESOURCES
There are four types of resource: extras, locations, organizations, and props.

Resources are usually represented by two or more dice of the same size, which may be used to aid a [[Tests]] or [[Contest]] where that resource is helpful or significant. Players choose how many resource dice to roll, although only the highest result is added to the total. Resource dice are rolled separately from the [[Dice Pool]] and, after they’re rolled, those dice are considered spent and can be recovered later during downtime.

A resource die is committed **before** the [[Tests]] or [[Contest]] dice pool is rolled but rolled separately. If more than one resource die is spent to aid a test or contest, only the highest rolling die is applied. This result is then added to the total.

Resources are recovered at the beginning of every session, or during any narrative period of downtime (such as a week of relaxation). Resources can be refreshed by spending [[Plot Point]] on a one for one basis (one [[Plot Point]] for one resource die recovered).

## IN OUR GAME
We have a special resource "Grit" that refreshes once per session, and is simply three d6s that can be added to any roll. These are better than Hero Dice because they don't require PPs to be used, but need to be committed **BEFORE** the roll, and cannot be higher than a d6.

# ROLES
 A role acts like a skill group or skill set, rather than a specific skill, and reflects a PC’s experience, training, or proficiency in a broad thematic area.

Roles are rated from **d4** to **d12**, like other traits. Each PC usually has at least one **d10**, one **d8**, and one **d4**, with the rest at **d6**. A role’s die rating represents a PC’s training and skill level when acting within that role.

- **d4** *Untrained*: You have no idea what you’re doing, and you’re likely to create trouble when you try it, but who knows.
- **d6** *Competent*: Sufficient training to get by. You’re comfortable doing this.
- **d8** *Expert*: Able to do this for a living. This is second nature to you.
- **d10** *Master*: One of the best in the field. Likely known to others who possess the skill.
- **d12** *Grandmaster*: One of the best in the world. Known even to those outside the field.

See more about [[Roles]]

*In our game:*

- **Ranger** (nature): Ones responsible for keeping nature and ecology functional, prevent poaching, develop and protect nature in general, or even interact with it. They also have knowledge over healing others on the field.
- **Bard** (people): The lore keepers of the world, everything people live by and leave behind is dear to their hearts. Tales and legends, lousy tavern songs, local laws and traditions, latest news and gossip from the market square. They know ways to people's hearts and heads, as well as over them.
- **Caravanner** (business): The uniting links of the world, those bring goods, news and people between places; they usually are the ones behind the airfleets, maintaining big markets, and may have a say in decision making of many settlements by the virtue of huge investment in their prosperity. Caravanner path may lead to wealth and power, but isn't an easy one.
- **Technician** (magic/technology): Maintains infrastructure and machinery, has knowledge over how to operate over all the major magic/tech families, at least at a basic level.
- **Wastes-diver** (exploration): They lead exploratory missions out into the wastes, wander the world in search of whatever there is to find; they can navigate in the wastes and survive in them, scavengers, able to make do with whatever is on hand.
- **Guardian** (aggression): They know how to defend others, primarily from the Growth. They have ties with the military organizations, and are respected by many. More than anything else, they know what they need to do to prevent shit from hitting the fan in the first place.

# VALUES
Values represent how much specific things matter to the PC and, in turn, how much they influence the outcome of [[tests]] and [[Contest]]. They can embody such things as societal mores, cultural principles, or elements of a code of honor or behavior. As with relationships, a high rating in a value doesn’t mean your character likes or stands out as a paragon of that value, but rather that they are more invested and concerned about that value than if they had it at a lower die rating. A **d10** in Truth could still mean the character is a liar, but the concept of truth and falsehood is one of the things that drives them the most to succeed.

The die rating of a value measures how much the value matters to the character, as follows:

- **d4** I’m really not into this.
- **d6** Sure, this matters. But so do a lot of things.
- **d8** This is definitely on my radar.
- **d10** I’m all over this thing.
- **d12** This is my heart and soul.

See more about [[Values]]

*In our game:*

- **Ambition**: fuels the drive to achieve goals, reach higher, and realize one's fullest potential. It embodies the relentless pursuit of success, innovation, and the desire to leave a mark on the world, encouraging characters to dream big and overcome any obstacles in their path to greatness.
- **Cooperation**: represents the unity among different species and the collective effort to restore and preserve the world. It's about working together, sharing resources, and protecting the environment from further harm.
- **Cleverness**: highlights your character's creativity in using technology and magic to solve problems. It encourages thinking outside the box, inventing new solutions, and improving life amidst the ruins.
- **Faith**: combines the courage to face formidable challenges with the hope for a brighter future. It's about believing in oneself, one's allies, and the cause, pushing forward even when the odds are against you.
- **Legacy**: is about valuing the past to empower the future. It emphasizes the importance of learning from history, preserving knowledge and traditions, and understanding ancient magics to navigate the present.
- **Integrity**: is about honesty, ethical action, and standing by one's moral convictions. It encourages characters to make the right choices, even when they are difficult, and to be true to themselves and their companions.
- **Curiosity**: is driven by its namesake and the urge to explore the unknown. It's about seeking out new knowledge, uncovering hidden truths, and unraveling the mysteries of the world to find ways to make it better.

# SIGNATURE ASSETS
Some characters have iconic weapons, gear, pets, or trustworthy allies that contribute to their dice pools reliably throughout play. These are signature assets that the character doesn’t have to create during play as they “belong” to the character and act much like any other trait.

## USING SIGNATURE ASSETS
A signature asset belongs to a PC and is recorded on their [[Character File]]—it doesn’t need to be created during play and it gives the player an extra die to include in their [[Dice Pool]] when they can justify their use. Unlike skills or attributes, [[Signature Assets]] are about things a PC has or people they know, not about qualities innate to them. These [[Assets]] are a great way to further reveal a PC’s personality as a means of representing heirlooms or unique weapons or special relationships.

[[Signature Assets]] can be temporarily knocked out, eliminated, rendered unusable, or damaged during play; but as they’re a featured element of the PC’s [[Character File]], the player can recover the signature asset between sessions or by spending a [[Plot Point]] at the beginning of the next scene (with some narrative justification for getting it back/fixed).

## RATING SIGNATURE ASSETS
[[Signature Assets]] begin with a **d6** die rating but can be stepped up during play. They aren’t tied to a distinction, attribute, or skill, but may complement any one of those traits. The die rating of your signature asset represents how much the [[Assets]] can help you, as well as your own bond with it.

- **d6** Something helpful and everyday, or that you’ve grown accustomed to
- **d8** Something special and interesting, or that you have a strong connection to
- **d10** Something rare and potent, or that you are defined by
- **d12** Something truly unique and powerful, or that transcends even your innate abilities

## SIGNATURE ASSETS AND SFX
[[Signature Assets]] can simply be a die rating on a character file, or the player can unlock an [[SFX]]. There’s no default [[SFX]] for a signature asset, and no two signature assets are the same, so typically a conversation with the GM about appropriate options is necessary before an [[SFX]] can be added.

Typical [[SFX]] for signature assets allow the player to spend a [[Plot Point]] to step up a [[trait]] when the signature asset is used with it, especially when the signature asset is itself a tool of some kind.

See more about [[Signature Assets]]

# SPECIALTIES
A [[Specialties]] is a narrow area of concentration or focus. [[Specialties]] are rated from **d6** to **d12**.

- **d6** You’re trained.
- **d8** You’re an expert.
- **d10** You’re a master.
- **d12** You’re a grandmaster.

There’s no default specialty level for all characters—if you don’t have a specialty, it’s assumed the kinds of activity included in the specialty aren’t relevant or significant to your character.

Each Specialty has its own descriptor (e.g. "Deduction", "Hacking"), they're free form, so long as they're narrow enough.

See more about [[Specialties]]

# SFX
SFX is short for “special effect.” It’s usually some kind of benefit or bonus that only occurs under certain conditions. SFX are used as a way to introduce exception-based rules for [[Trait Sets]] that possess them (Distinctions and Signature Assets). They’re a way to break the rules of the game, modify the outcome of [[tests]] and [[Contest]], and add more texture to the story.

See more about [[SFX]]

# SCRATCH BUILT CHARACTERS
![[Scratch Built Characters]]

# VEHICLES
Each vehicle keeps its own [[Character File]], and has Attributes (Engines, Frame, Systems), [[Distinctions]] (Model, History, Customization) with [[SFX]], and optionally [[Signature Assets]] optionally with [[SFX]] as well.

When assembling [[Dice Pool]] with [[Vehicles]], a player REPLACES an Attribute with  one of the [[Vehicles]]'s Attributes (in our game, [[Values]] are replaced by [[Vehicles]] Attributes). Additionally, both a character's and the [[Vehicles]]'s [[Distinction]] are added to the pool. One [[Signature Assets]] from a player and one [[Signature Assets]] from a [[Vehicles]] can both be added, if appropriate.

[[Vehicles]] can be "grown" in the same way as a [[Player]] - but a Player must spend the Character's "Sessions" to do so, upgrading the [[Vehicles]] rather than their own Character.

## BUILDING A VEHICLE
[[Vehicles]] are typically built using the scratch built character creation method, though some settings where [[Vehicles]] are more important may offer other options.

Building a [[Vehicles]] follows these steps:

1. Pick a model [[distinction]] and assign a **d8** to each attribute.
2. Step up one attribute by one or two steps, and step down one or both of the attributes by the same total number of steps. Alternatively, keep all attributes at **d8**.
3. Pick a history [[distinction]].
4. Pick a customization [[distinction]].
5. Assign the Hinder [[SFX]] to each [[distinction]].
6. Choose or create two additional [[SFX]] to attach to one or two [[distinctions]].
7. Create two [[Signature Assets]] rated at **d8** representing a special feature or minor GMC.
8. Name the [[Vehicles]], and discuss biographical information.

# SCALE
![[Scale]]

# COMPLICATIONS
A [[Complications]] is an unhelpful temporary [[trait]] that the opposition includes in their [[Dice Pool]] to make the opposed roll harder for the character with the [[Complications]]. [[Complications]] should be given descriptive names and a die rating, usually a **d6** to start.

## CREATING COMPLICATIONS
When a player rolls a [[Hitches]] (a 1) on any of their dice, the GM can hand over a [[Plot Point]] to create a [[Complications]]. This doesn’t affect the success or failure of the roll—a [[Complications]] means something else has gone wrong, making life difficult.

[[Complications]] start at **d6**, and additional [[Hitches]] in the same roll step up the [[Complications]] without the GM giving the player more [[Plot Point]]. The GM may choose to create multiple [[Complications]] if there is more than one [[Hitches]], but each new [[Complications]] requires handing over a [[Plot Point]]. If the player rolls a **botch**, the GM creates a **d6** [[Complications]] without giving the player a [[Plot Point]], and steps it up for each [[Hitches]] past the first.

[[Complications]] are persistent and last until either the PC has recovered from them, or the [[Complications]] is made irrelevant.

## USING COMPLICATIONS
Whenever a player or the GM is rolling against a character that has a relevant [[Complications]], they may add it to their [[Dice Pool]]. Doing so doesn’t cost anything, and there’s no limit to how many applicable [[Complications]] can be included in a [[Dice Pool]], nor is there a limit on how many [[Complications]] a character can have.

## RECOVERING COMPLICATIONS
Many [[Complications]] are temporary problems that will go away before the next scene begins. [[Complications]] that represent major consequences, however, stick around. To get rid of them, PCs must test their [[traits]] to recover.

Getting rid of or reducing a [[Complications]] is a [[Tests]] vs a [[Dice Pool]] consisting of the [[Complications]] and a base difficulty of **d8** **d8**. The GM may rule that other [[traits]] affect the roll, similar to a standard [[Tests]]. Narratively, to make a roll the PC attempting the [[Tests]] and the circumstances surrounding it must be capable of improving the situation.

When the [[Tests]] is complete, one of the following happens:

- If the PC beat the difficulty and the effect die is greater than the complication, the complication is eliminated.
- If the PC beat the difficulty and the effect die is equal to or smaller than the complication, the complication is stepped down by one. Time must pass before another test can be made to recover the complication.
- If the PC failed to beat the difficulty, the complication remains as it is.
- If the PC beat the difficulty but rolled a hitch, the GM may hand over a [[Plot Point]] and introduce a new complication related to the one that was just recovered.
- If the PC failed to beat the difficulty and rolled a hitch, the complication is stepped up by one step for every hitch rolled.

See more about [[Complications]]

# TAKEN OUT
When a character is taken out, they may no longer perform any test or contest and no longer participate in the scene. Generally, a character that’s taken out of a scene has no further impact on the scene’s outcome.

A character may be taken out when they:

- Fail to beat their opponent in a high stakes contest and lose, suffering the consequences on their opponent’s terms
- Fail a test in a high stakes scene
- Have a complication or stress die stepped up beyond **d12**.

Instead of being taken out, a player may spend a [[Plot Point]] and take a complication instead. The die rating of the complication is equal to the effect die of the opposition. If the complication comes from something other than a die roll, it begins at a default **d6**.

See more about [[Taken Out]]

# RECOVERY
![[Recovery]]

# GROWTH
While PCs start out as competent, experienced professionals, they can change and grow during play, with each job they take giving them more to grow on. The more adventures the group undertakes, the more benefits they can enjoy and the richer their backstory becomes.
