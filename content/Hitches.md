# Hitches
Any **1** (a [[Hitches]]) rolled on a die does not count toward the total at all and can’t be used as an effect die. It’s called a hitch because it’s a little obstacle that could lead to an inconvenience—a complication—without ensuring failure. The GM has the option to activate those hitches to give the PC [[Complications]], giving the player a [[Plot Point]] in exchange. If the player’s dice include multiple **1**s, the GM can step up the complication for each additional hitch without giving any additional [[Plot Point|Plot Points]]. The GM might also roll hitches—called Opportunities—which the players can activate.

## BOTCHES
If all the dice roll **1**s, that's a critical failure. The total is zero. The GM can introduce a **d6** complication without paying a [[Plot Point]] and step it up as many times as there are hitches past the first.

## OPPORTUNITIES
When the GM rolls a **1** on their dice, this hitch is also known as an Opportunity. Any player can spend a [[Plot Point]] to activate the opportunity to either:
- Step down an existing [[Complications]] to a smaller size die. A **d6** becomes a **d4**, and a **d4** goes away.
- Step up an existing [[Assets]]—to a maximum of **d12**—for the rest of the scene. Even [[Signature Assets]] can be temporarily stepped up in this way. If the GM’s dice include multiple **1**s, players may step up or down their [[Assets]] or [[Complications]] multiple times and still only pay a single [[Plot Point]] per trait affected.
