# DISTINCTIONS
Distinctions are a trait that represents a character’s background, personality, and role in the game and that differentiates them from other PCs and GMCs. Distinctions are usually a [[Prime Sets]] in any Cortex game. Distinctions might be player-created or the GM might prepare a big list of them to choose from.

## USING DISTINCTIONS
To inspire roleplaying, PCs have three distinctions rated at **d8** that paint a clearer picture of their background, personality, and role in the story. Just by looking at your character’s three distinctions you should have a clear impression of who they are and how their past has shaped them. The choice of when to use a distinction is the player’s, but it must make narrative sense to do so.

Distinctions are one of the main ways to earn [[Plot Points]]. Every Cortex Prime game should include distinctions as one of the [[Prime Sets]], which means your distinctions should be varied and broad enough that one of them will apply almost every time you put together a [[Dice Pool]].

Distinctions are frequently paired up with [[SFX]]—in fact, all of them have the Hinder [[SFX]]: “Gain a [[Plot Point]] when you switch out this distinction’s die for a **d4**.” You can assign more [[SFX]] to a distinction but leave them locked until the player earns [[growth]]. See [[SFX]] and [[Growth]] for more.

## SCENE DISTINCTIONS
You can give a [[Location]] some personality by applying scene distinctions. These work like distinctions on characters, complete with the Hinder [[SFX]], but can be used by any character in the [[scene]].

You can expand this by adding location-specific [[SFX]] to a [[Location]]’s [[scene]] distinctions, such as spending a [[Plot Point]] to create [[Location]]-specific [[Assets]]. Both GMCs and PCs might make use of [[scene]] distinction [[SFX]] if they’re made available.

See [[Location]] for more.

## VEHICLE DISTINCTIONS
In some settings, [[Vehicles]] are as important to the story as the characters are. To make vehicles come to life, each group of players maintains a vehicle file, a bit like a [[Character File]]. They receive distinctions just like PCs. Players start vehicle construction by selecting the model distinction. In addition to the model distinction, players should choose two more distinctions for the vehicle. One represents the vehicle’s history, and another its customization. Each distinction gets the Hinder: Gain a [[Plot Point]] when you switch out this distinction’s **d8** for a **d4**
[[SFX]] for free. Players should choose two additional [[SFX]] to unlock (if you have prepared distinctions in advance for your group) or come up with two additional [[SFX]] to attach to one or two of your distinctions.
