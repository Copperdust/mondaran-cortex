# HEROIC SUCCESS

When you roll a truly spectacular total, you can achieve a heroic success.

In a [[Tests]] if you beat the difficulty by 5 or more on a roll, you’ve got a heroic success. You not only get what you want, your roll produces unexpected beneficial results. In a [[Contest]], if your opponent loses by 5 or more, you’ve got a heroic success and are the clear victor.

As with any success, the GM should ask you to describe your amazing efforts, but the effect die is also stepped up by one for every 5 points you beat the difficulty by.
In the event that your effect die is a **d12** and you gain a heroic success, or you get multiple heroic successes that would step up your effect die past a **d12**, follow the usual rules for stepping up a die rating after **d12**.

You can:
• Include a second unused die from your roll as a second [[effect die]] to create another [[Assets]] or different type of [[Complications]] starting at ⑥
• Add a second [[effect die]] at a ⑥ if you have none leftover
• Take your opponent out instantly

Some [[SFX]] might specify a heroic success as the activating element. Often, these sorts of [[SFX]] create additional [[Assets]] or [[Complications]] beyond the one that 
may have been created from the test or contest, or they change the story in some interesting way by introducing a specific flavor to the outcome.

Heroic Successes create [[Hero Dice]].
