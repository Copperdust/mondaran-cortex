# HELPING OTHERS
A group of PCs working together in a single [[scene]] may want to help one another. Outside of a player having their character take their own actions and make decisions in a scene to progress the action and story, these game mechanics let you offer more direct assistance.

## HELPING WITH ASSETS
At any time, players can spend a [[Plot Point]] to share an [[Assets]] they have with every character in the [[scene]], or to create a relevant ⑥ [[Assets]] for themselves or another PC for the duration of the [[scene]].

Alternatively, on their turn a PC can attempt a test to create a new [[Assets]], which they can give to another PC if they succeed.

## HELPING WITH GANGING UP
PCs can choose to gang up in support of one of their team members. To do this, they hand over a single die of the appropriate [[Trait]] to the character leading the charge, who adds them to their [[Dice Pool]] to roll. This doesn’t change the number of dice added together to set or beat the difficulty (it’s still two), just the number of dice rolled.

This comes with a risk. If the opponent beats the leading PC, they can compare their [[effect die]] to one of the supporting PC dice, possibly causing the helping PC 
to be [[taken out]] as if they had lost the fight. As usual, a PC can spend a [[Plot Point]] to take a [[Complications]] to avoid being [[taken out]], but even if they do, they can’t continue to gang up with the leading PC.

## MORAL SUPPORT
This mod for helping others uses the [[Values]] [[Trait Sets]]. On another player’s turn in a challenge, or when they’re in a [[Contest]], you can step down one of your [[Values]] die ratings by one in order to step up that same [[Values]] in their own [[Dice Pool]] for that roll. Your value remains stepped down until the end of the session.
