# TRAITS
Each PC’s [[Character File]] is mostly a list of traits and related game stats. Traits define a character and how they interact with the world they live in. They paint a picture of who a character is and what they can do, not just in terms of their skills and abilities but also their personality, background, or aspirations.

Almost all traits have die ratings, usually between **d4** and **d12**. When that trait comes into play, the player rolls that die as part of their [[Dice Pool]].

## TRAIT SETS
Any collection of traits that belong to the same basic type is assumed to be part of a trait set. **The rule of thumb in Cortex Prime is that you may only add one trait from any given trait set to a dice pool without added cost**. If you want to include more, it costs a [[Plot Point]].

Every Cortex Prime game needs at least two [[Prime Sets]] in addition to [[distinctions]]. These are the source of almost every [[Dice Pool]] used in [[tests]] and [[Contest]]. Games can have additional trait sets beyond their prime sets. These are not included in every [[Dice Pool]], only when they are relevant.

A character may be defined by as few as three and as many as six or seven trait sets, depending on the game.

## TEMPORARY TRAITS
In play, characters may gain temporary traits, which last for a short time—a [[scene]], or maybe a session. Temporary traits can also be assigned directly to a [[scene]] or to a [[Location]], and either go away when circumstances make them irrelevant (like a Flaming Torch ⑥ once it’s doused in a lake) or when some other time limit is reached. [[Assets]] and [[Complications]] are the most common examples of temporary traits.

## IN OUR GAME
We use the following [[Prime Sets]] traits in our game:

- [[Distinctions]]
- [[Values]]
- [[Roles]]

And we use the following Traits overall:

- [[Signature Assets]]
- [[Specialties]]

### ABILITY TRAIT

First introduced in Smallville Roleplaying Game

Abilities are a trait set mod of powers that create a cinematic, prime time drama approach to superpowers and SFX. An ability is a rated trait with a number of SFX, effect tags, and descriptor tags attached to it along with a limit to give PCs incredible, specific superpowers.

See Abilities for more.

### AFFILIATION TRAIT

First introduced in Marvel Heroic Roleplaying

Affiliations are a trait set of usually three rated traits that reflect how well the character performs in specific contextual situations, like environments, social structures, or circumstances.

See Affiliations for more.

### ATTRIBUTE TRAIT

First introduced in Serenity Roleplaying Game

Attributes represent raw ability, prowess, and effort. They rarely offer an insight into a character’s experience, training, or external circumstances. They make a good baseline for a prime set.

See Attributes for more. DISTINCTION TRAIT

First introduced in Leverage Roleplaying Game

A trait that represents a character’s background, personality, and role in the game and differentiates them from other PCs and GMCs. Distinctions are considered a universal prime set, so regardless of what sets are used in your game, every character should have three distinctions broad and varied enough that you can narratively justify including one in almost any dice pool.

See Distinctions for more.

### POWER TRAIT

First introduced in Marvel Heroic Roleplaying

A power is a special kind of trait that represents super-

human ability or some extraordinary quality that most normal humans or baseline characters don’t have. The origin or source of powers varies from setting to setting—radiation, genetic mutation, sorcery, high-tech gadgets, etc. Powers can also be used to represent gear or special equipment, making it possible to mix heroes of varying power origins together with the same system.

See Powers for more.

### POWER SET TRAIT

First introduced in Marvel Heroic Roleplaying

A power set is a mod that adds thematic strength to a collection of power traits. Power sets usually come with a limit that governs them, one or more helpful SFX, and a single origin or source that explains why your character has these powers. Each power set counts as a trait set of its own.

See Powers for more.

### RELATIONSHIP TRAIT

First introduced in Smallville Roleplaying Game

Relationships are traits that represent the intensity and importance of a character’s connection to another character or group of characters. This connection may be positive or negative in nature, so long as it motivates and empowers the character who has it.

See Relationships for more.

### REPUTATION TRAIT

First introduced in Firefly Role-Playing Game

A reputation is a relationship trait mod that may be used alongside relationships or in place of them. Reputations work like relationships do, except they represent a character’s standing with a group, organization, company, or culture.

See Relationships for more. RESOURCE TRAIT

First introduced in Smallville Roleplaying Game

Resources are helpful things outside of a character themselves that are expendable and recoverable. There are four types of resource: extras, locations, organizations, and props.

See Resources for more.

### ROLE TRAIT

First introduced in Leverage Roleplaying Game

Roles are a skill-like trait mod that replaces skills in some expressions of Cortex Prime. A role acts like a skill group or skill set, rather than a specific skill, and reflects a PC’s experience, training, or proficiency in a broad thematic area.

See Roles for more.

### SIGNATURE ASSET TRAIT

First introduced in Leverage Roleplaying Game

A signature asset belongs to a PC and is recorded on their character file—it doesn’t need to be created during play and it gives the player an extra die to include in their dice pools when they can justify their use.

Unlike skills or attributes, signature assets are about things a PC has or people they know, not about qualities innate to them. These assets are a great way to further reveal a PC’s personality as a means of representing heirlooms or unique weapons or special relationships.

See Signature Assets for more.

### SKILL TRAIT

First introduced in Serenity Roleplaying Game

Skills represent natural talent, training, or experience. If you can describe it as a verb, it’s a good candidate for a skill. Most skill lists for Cortex games consist of verbs.

See Skills for more.

### SPECIALTY TRAIT

First introduced in Leverage Roleplaying Game

A specialty is a narrow area of concentration or focus. Specialties can be used in many different ways, both in conjunction with skills, the trait set they are a mod for, and separately.

See Specialties for more.

### TALENT TRAIT

First introduced in Leverage Roleplaying Game

A talent is a special trait that doesn’t have a die rating and consists of some descriptive or narrative text with an SFX, separate from a distinction. Talents are helpful in a game where characters from similar origins need to be distinct from one another, or where the other traits are less numerous or are broad in scope.

See Talents for more. VALUE

### VALUES

First introduced in Smallville Roleplaying Game

Values represent how much specific things matter to the PC and, in turn, how much they influence the outcome of tests and contests. They can embody such things as societal mores, cultural principles, or elements of a code of honor or behavior.

See Values for more.

## MAKING TRAITS SPECIAL

Traits can be as simple as a name and a die rating, but can also add additional depth or complexity by using SFX and trait statements.

### TRAIT SFX

First introduced in Smallville Roleplaying Game

SFX is short for “special effect.” It’s usually some kind of benefit or bonus that only occurs under certain conditions. In Cortex Prime, SFX are used as a way to introduce exception-based rules for trait sets that possess them. They’re a way to break the rules of the game, modify the outcome of tests and contests, and add more texture to the story.

All distinctions get the Hinder: Gain a [[Plot Point]] when you switch out this distinction’s ⑧ for a **d4** SFX for free, and other trait sets may have one or more SFX to give context to the traits in the set.

See SFX for more.

### TRAIT STATEMENTS

First introduced in Smallville Roleplaying Game

A statement is a sentence or phrase that clarifies or refines the trait that it’s attached to. One or more trait sets may be assigned trait statements. They’re especially useful when assigned to values, relationships, or attributes. They signify which trait sets you want at the center of your game’s dramatic tension.

See Statements for more.

### VEHICLE TRAITS

When vehicles need more mechanical weight than a signature asset, they can be assigned several traits that can be added to dice pools when PCs make tests or contests. These traits sometimes replace and sometimes complement or supplement existing PC traits.

See Vehicles for more.
