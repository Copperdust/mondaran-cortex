# TEST
A test is the central mechanic of rolling dice to resolve a situation by determining if there’s a successful outcome or a challenging failure. Almost always, tests are initiated by the GM asking the player, “What do you do?” If the outcome is guaranteed, a test can be resolved without rolling dice. The GM can declare that the test is an automatic success, or the player can choose not to respond to a test and find another way forward. There’s usually no need for an effect die, but if one is needed, use the largest die in the player’s dice pool if it’s an automatic success, or in the opposition pool if it’s an automatic failure.

## ENGAGING IN A TEST
The GM assembles an opposition pool and rolls it, setting the difficulty by adding together two dice from the roll and announcing the total. The difficulty is the number the player needs to beat with their own total when they roll the dice for the test. If the player’s total beats the difficulty, the test is a success. If the player’s total is lower or equal to the difficulty, the test is a failure. Tests are usually uncomplicated. A success means the character does what they wanted to do, and a failure means they don’t.

## SETTING THE DIFFICULTY FOR TESTS
The difficulty dice are always two dice of the same number of sides, based on the situation:

- VERY EASY: d4-d4
- EASY: d6-d6
- CHALLENGING: d8-d8
- HARD: d10-d10
- VERY HARD: d12-d12

In addition to difficulty dice, the GM picks up one or more dice based on appropriate traits from the location, opposing GMCs, or the scene itself. The GM can also add one or more d6 to represent increasing risks or threats. Occasionally a player might set the difficulty for a GMC’s test. In this case, the player rolls first and the GM rolls to beat the difficulty set by the player. Most often, though, tests are the realm of the PCs.

## SPECIAL TYPES OF TESTS
There are various types of tests you might use in your Cortex game:

### ASSET TESTS
To create an asset by attempting a test, a player declares what their character does to create the asset and assembles an appropriate dice pool. The GM rolls to set the difficulty, usually with something basic like d6-d6. The effect die of the test becomes the die rating of the asset. The GM may set a cap on the size of assets created this way by setting the difficulty dice to that die rating. The asset created may not be larger than this die cap. This can also be used to create assets representing clues. Anytime a PC wants to get a read on somebody, case a scene, spot something out of the ordinary, or generally just use their senses, they’re creating an asset. With a successful test, the PC gains some crucial information. If the PC spends a Plot Point after succeeding at the test, they can bank the asset until they need it, give it to another character, or keep it for longer. With a failed test, the PC doesn’t gain any useful advantage. If there are complications, they generally represent the consequences of poking around places trying to find stuff out. See Assets for more.

### RECOVERY TESTS
Getting rid of or reducing a complication is a test vs a dice pool consisting of the complication and a base difficulty of d8-d8. Other traits may also affect the roll, and the PC or their circumstances must be capable of improving the situation to make a roll. When the test is complete, one of the following happens:

- If you beat the difficulty and your effect die is greater than the complication, the complication is eliminated.
- If you beat the difficulty and the effect die is equal to or smaller than the complication, the complication is stepped down by one. You can’t try to recover that complication again until time passes.
- If you fail to beat the difficulty, the complication remains as it is.
- If you beat the difficulty but roll a hitch, the GM may hand over a Plot Point and introduce a new complication related to the one that was just recovered.
- If you fail to beat the difficulty and roll a hitch, the complication is stepped up by one step for every hitch rolled.
