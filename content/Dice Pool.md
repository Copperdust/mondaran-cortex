When rolling dice for a [[Tests]] or [[Contest]], assemble a dice pool by choosing an appropriate die from each of the [[Prime Sets]] and any other relevant [[Traits]] on the [[Character File]], plus any bonus [[dice]] from other sources. The [[Dice Pool]] represents all of the various things that might contribute to success. Thereâ€™s no maximum number of [[dice]] in a [[Dice Pool]], but generally the pool includes anywhere from three to eight [[dice]].
