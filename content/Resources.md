# RESOURCES
There are four types of resource: extras, locations, organizations, and props.

Resources are usually represented by two or more dice of the same size, which may be used to aid a [[Tests]] or [[Contest]] where that resource is helpful or significant. Players choose how many resource dice to roll, although only the highest result is added to the total. Resource dice are rolled separately from the [[Dice Pool]] and, after they’re rolled, those dice are considered spent and can be recovered later during downtime.

## USING RESOURCES
Include resources when you want an [[Assets]] that is exhaustible and renewable. You might use all four kinds of resource or just one or two types.

• Extra: An extra is a type of GMC, but when it’s attached to a PC it represents a contact or ally the player may draw on for help.
• Location: A location is a place in the game setting that may be used to set scenes or provide valuable resources.
• Organization (org): An organization is a group of people who function under a specific ideology, structure, or goal. An org resource may open channels that the PC doesn’t have alone.
• Prop: A prop is a tool, object, or item that helps a PC broaden the scope of what they can achieve in specific situations.

A resource die is committed **before** the [[Tests]] or [[Contest]] dice pool is rolled but rolled separately. If more than one resource die is spent to aid a test or contest, only the highest rolling die is applied. This result is then added to the total.

Resources are recovered at the beginning of every session, or during any narrative period of downtime (such as a week of relaxation). Resources can be refreshed by spending [[Plot Point]] on a one for one basis (one [[Plot Point]] for one resource die recovered).

### RATING RESOURCES
Every resource has a name, a die rating (nearly always in multiples of **d6**, but sometimes rated with larger dice), and (optionally) a tag or label to indicate what kind of field or quality that resource belongs to, such as Politics, Crime, Academics, or Military. If you use tags, each listed resource should have two of them, and they should inform you of the kind of test or contest that the resource might apply to. A GM can spend a [[Plot Point]] to invoke GMC resources to add to an opposition pool total.

### RESOURCES VS SIGNATURE ASSETS VS HERO DICE
A resource is similar in many ways to a [[Signature Assets]] in that it’s a [[trait]] that represents an external person, object, place, or thing that contributes to a character’s [[Dice Pool]] total in a [[Tests]] or [[Contest]]. It’s also similar to a [[Hero Dice]] in that it’s rolled separately and added to the total.

Resource dice are more helpful than [[Signature Assets]] because they always increase the potential total in a [[Tests]] or [[Contest]], but the downside is that they’re spent, whereas a [[Signature Assets]] can be used as many times as is justifiable. See [[Signature Assets]] for more.

Resource dice are more helpful than [[Hero Dice]] because they don’t require [[Plot Points]] to activate them, but the downside is that they can only be used in specific circumstances, represented by that resource’s tag. [[Hero Dice]] can be used on any test or contest, regardless of the nature of that [[Tests]] or [[Contest]].
