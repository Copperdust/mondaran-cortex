# SPECIALTIES
A specialty is a narrow area of concentration or focus. Specialties can be used in many different ways, either in conjunction with skills, the [[Trait Sets]] they are a mod for, or separately.

In our game, we don't use skills, just specialties.

## SPECIALTIES MOD NO SKILLS, JUST SPECIALTIES
A Cortex Prime game that doesn’t use skills as a [[Trait Sets]] may choose to use specialties as a [[trait]] on their own. With this mod, specialties are usually rated from **d8** to **d12**, rather than being set at **d6**. Some games may start specialties at **d6** instead, but they don’t use a **d4** rating.

- **d6** You’re trained.
- **d8** You’re an expert.
- **d10** You’re a master.
- **d12** You’re a grandmaster.

Unlike skills, there’s no default specialty level for all characters—if you don’t have a specialty, it’s assumed the kinds of activity included in the specialty aren’t relevant or significant to your character.

Without skills, it’s useful to create a master list of specialties to choose from so that the thematic aspects of the setting are maintained. This list is usually provided by the game setting, or by the GM.
