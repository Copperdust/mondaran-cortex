# ROLES
Roles is a skill-like trait mod that replaces skills in some expressions of Cortex Prime. A role acts like a skill group or skill set, rather than a specific skill, and reflects a PC’s experience, training, or proficiency in a broad thematic area. Games that use roles should usually have no fewer than three and no more than six roles, though exceptions can be made.

## USING ROLES
Roles are a good choice for a Cortex Prime game that requires specialization without removing the ability to use certain skills. This includes action-heavy or team-oriented games of all genres. When using roles, specialties allow for narrow focus in a role’s area of proficiency.

## RATING ROLES
Roles are rated from **d4** to **d12**, like other traits. Each PC usually has at least one **d10**, one **d8**, and one **d4**, with the rest at **d6**. A role’s die rating represents a PC’s training and skill level when acting within that role.

- **d4** *Untrained*: You have no idea what you’re doing, and you’re likely to create trouble when you try it, but who knows.

- **d6** *Competent*: Sufficient training to get by. You’re comfortable doing this.

- **d8** *Expert*: Able to do this for a living. This is second nature to you.

- **d10** *Master*: One of the best in the field. Likely known to others who possess the skill.

- **d12** *Grandmaster*: One of the best in the world. Known even to those outside the field.
