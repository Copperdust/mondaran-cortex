# SIGNATURE ASSETS
Some characters have iconic weapons, gear, pets, or trustworthy allies that contribute to their dice pools reliably throughout play. These are signature assets that the character doesn’t have to create during play as they “belong” to the character and act much like any other trait.

## USING SIGNATURE ASSETS
A signature asset belongs to a PC and is recorded on their [[Character File]]—it doesn’t need to be created during play and it gives the player an extra die to include in their [[Dice Pool]] when they can justify their use. Unlike skills or attributes, [[Signature Assets]] are about things a PC has or people they know, not about qualities innate to them. These [[Assets]] are a great way to further reveal a PC’s personality as a means of representing heirlooms or unique weapons or special relationships.

[[Signature Assets]] can be temporarily knocked out, eliminated, rendered unusable, or damaged during play; but as they’re a featured element of the PC’s [[Character File]], the player can recover the signature asset between sessions or by spending a [[Plot Point]] at the beginning of the next scene (with some narrative justification for getting it back/fixed).

## RATING SIGNATURE ASSETS
[[Signature Assets]] begin with a **d6** die rating but can be stepped up during play. They aren’t tied to a distinction, attribute, or skill, but may complement any one of those traits. The die rating of your signature asset represents how much the [[Assets]] can help you, as well as your own bond with it.

- **d6** Something helpful and everyday, or that you’ve grown accustomed to
- **d8** Something special and interesting, or that you have a strong connection to
- **d10** Something rare and potent, or that you are defined by
- **d12** Something truly unique and powerful, or that transcends even your innate abilities

## SIGNATURE ASSETS AND SFX
Signature assets can simply be a die rating on a character file, or the player can unlock an [[SFX]]. There’s no default [[SFX]] for a signature asset, and no two signature assets are the same, so typically a conversation with the GM about appropriate options is necessary before an [[SFX]] can be added.

Typical [[SFX]] for signature assets allow the player to spend a [[Plot Point]] to step up a [[trait]] when the signature asset is used with it, especially when the signature asset is itself a tool of some kind.

## SHARING SIGNATURE ASSETS
A signature asset is made up of two things: your connection to something, and the something you’re connected to. The die rating belongs to your connection, not to the thing itself. You and another character might both possess a signature asset, but at different die ratings.

Signature assets cannot be shared between PCs; if someone “borrows” a signature asset from a character (picking up the other character’s heirloom sword or driving their custom sports car), the borrower must spend a [[Plot Point]] to create an [[Assets]] as normal to get any benefit from the [[Assets]] borrowed, and the [[Assets]] is rated at **d6** like any other [[Plot Point]] created [[Assets]].

## VEHICLES WITH SIGNATURE ASSETS
In some settings, [[Vehicles]] are as important to the story as the characters are. To make vehicles come to life, each group of players maintains a vehicle file, a bit like a character file. Like individual PCs, vehicles can have signature assets that can be added to a dice pool. These assets represent modifications or resources that are available on the vehicle. Typically, vehicle signature assets have a rating of **d8**.

See [[Vehicles]] for more.

## RESOURCES VS SIGNATURE ASSETS
A [[Resources]] is similar in many ways to a signature asset in that it’s a [[trait]] that represents an external person, object, place, or thing that contributes to a character’s [[Dice Pool]] total in a [[Tests]] or [[Contest]].

[[Resources]] dice are more helpful than signature assets because they always increase the potential total in a [[Tests]] or [[Contest]], but the downside is that they’re spent, whereas a signature asset can be used as many times as is justifiable.
