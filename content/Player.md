# PLAYER
Each of the people playing the game, specifically the people who are not the game moderator (GM). Each player takes on the role of one player character, or PC.

See Player Character (PC) for more.

Players are responsible for:
• Deciding what their PCs do.
• Confronting any problems that the GM throws in front of them.
• Pointing their PCs in directions that make for good stories.
• Supporting other PCs and giving them a shot at what they’re good at.
• Deciding how their PCs change and grow over time.
• In general, telling the story of their PCs.

Additionally, each player is responsible for helping ensure that the gaming experience is enjoyable for everyone. [[Consent]] should always be part of a group’s conversation about social standards at the table. See [[Consent]] for more.

## PLAYING A CHARACTER
As a player, your interaction with the rules of a Cortex game setting comes down to playing the game, which you do through your player character, or PC. As you make decisions for your character and help to tell the story at the table, you’ll refer to your PC’s [[Character File]] to decide what traits and other game statistics or facts about them would come into play.

A [[Character File]] is the central record of essential game details for a character. All players maintain their own character file and the GM maintains (often abbreviated) files for important GMCs. [[Character File]] change throughout the game, so it’s important to be able to take notes on them.

See Player Character (PC) and Character File for more.

Using that [[Character File]] and the [[traits]] listed on it, you’ll gather [[dice]] together to form [[Dice Pool]] when you try to accomplish something where the outcome is uncertain or would be interesting to roll for. See [[Dice]] and [[Dice Pool]] for more.

## PLAYER PLOT POINTS
[[Plot Points]] are a way for players to affect the plot beyond the roll of the dice. [[Plot points]] can be spent to give players more [[dice]], make the [[dice]] they have more powerful, or activate certain [[traits]] or special effects ([[SFX]]) on a [[Character File]]. You need a way to keep track of [[Plot Points]]. You can write them as tally marks on your [[Character File]], file or use poker chips or some other kind of token.

Every player starts a game [[session]] with at least one [[Plot Points]]. Unspent [[Plot Points]] are carried over from [[session]] to [[session]], but it’s best to spend [[Plot Points]] when the opportunity arises—it’s not hard to get more during play.

The following are the standard ways to earn and spend [[Plot Points]] as a player, which may differ depending on the game and setting.

### Earning 
• Roll a [[Hitches]] (a 1) that the GM activates
• Give in during a [[Contest]]
• Activate an [[SFX]] like Hinder
• Engage in remarkable moments of roleplaying

### Spending
• Activate [[SFX]]
• Add two dice from a [[trait]] set instead of one
• Activate an opportunity (a 1) that the GM rolls
• Avoid being [[taken out]]
• Create a **d6** [[Assets]] for the [[scene]], or to keep an [[Assets]] for the rest of the [[Session]]
• Include an additional result in your total
• Interfere in a contest
• Keep an extra [[effect die]]
• Share an [[Assets]] with everyone in a [[scene]]
