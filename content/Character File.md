## PLAYER CHARACTER FILE
A character file is the central record of essential game details for a character. All players maintain their own character file and the GM maintains (often abbreviated) files for important GMCs. Character files change throughout the game, so it’s important to be able to take notes on them.

A character file needs to include space for all of the information players need to record and maintain, such as the different [[Trait Sets]] and their ratings, plus maybe stress, [[session records]], [[Hero Dice]], [[Signature Assets]], and other important game statistics. There’s no fixed [[Character File]] for Cortex Prime because there’s no fixed array of [[Trait Sets]]—every Cortex game is potentially different in that way.

Any officially published setting primed by Cortex includes a blank character file designed specifically for the [[traits]] and mods used in the setting, but sheets of paper, online documents, or sticky notes are other ways to collect your character’s details.
For examples of Cortex Prime [[Character File]], see the Cortex Prime Game Handbook and Tales of Xadia: The Dragon Prince Roleplaying Game.

In Tales of Xadia, [[Character File]] are called character journals.
