# DICE
Cortex Prime uses five kinds of dice: 4Ô∏è‚É£, 6Ô∏è‚É£, 8Ô∏è‚É£, üîü, 1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£. The number indicates how many sides the die has: the more sides, the bigger the numbers. A handful of dice is called a dice pool. When a die is rolled, the number on the uppermost face is the result. Add results together to get a total. The dice introduce a random element to play, helping us resolve tests and contests. Bigger dice (more sides) means potentially better outcomes, and more dice means more reliable outcomes. A communal pool of dice for the table is recommended, with at least three or four of each type. If playing online, use dice simulators for making virtual dice rolls. Make sure everyone playing approves of the method used, and that everyone can see the results of each die in the dice rolls. All dice rolls are made in the open.

## DIE SIZE
Cortex Prime uses game dice of various sizes: four-sided 4Ô∏è‚É£, six-sided 6Ô∏è‚É£, eight-sided 8Ô∏è‚É£, ten-sided üîü, and twelve-sided 1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ dice. The more sides a die has, the higher the numbers it might roll. For effect dice, the size is the only thing that matters.

## DIE RATING
Every trait in the game has a die rating. Whenever you use the trait, you pick up a die of that size for your dice pool. Die ratings usually correspond to how much effect that trait has on the outcome of any given test or contest.

## ROLLING DICE
Usually when you roll two or more dice, you choose two results to add together for your total, and a third die to use as the effect die. This is a roll and keep method of resolving an outcome. If you‚Äôre rolling one die, your total is equal to the result of that die. If you don‚Äôt have a third die, your effect die starts at 4Ô∏è‚É£. All rolls, including the GM‚Äôs, are done in the open. After rolling dice, leave them on the table in view of everyone. Only pick up the dice once a test or contest has been resolved.

You are free to choose any two dice for your total. You don‚Äôt need to choose the two highest rolling dice. You may want to save a die with more sides for your effect die, even if it was the highest result. Likewise, the GM may decide to let the dice fall where they may and always keep the two highest rolling dice, or use the choice of two dice as a way to moderate the opposition without simply fudging dice.

## RESULT
When you roll a die, the number on the uppermost face is the result.

## TOTAL
The total is the number you get when you add at least two of your dice results together after rolling your dice pool. Usually, it‚Äôs the two highest rolled dice results in a dice pool added together. There may be more or fewer results added together, depending on the circumstances.

## ROLLING A HITCH
Any 1Ô∏è‚É£ (a hitch) rolled on a die does not count toward the total at all and can‚Äôt be used as an effect die. It‚Äôs called a hitch because it‚Äôs a little obstacle that could lead to an inconvenience‚Äîa complication‚Äîwithout ensuring failure. The GM has the option to activate those hitches to give the PC complications, giving the player a üÖü‚óè in exchange. If the player‚Äôs dice include multiple 1Ô∏è‚É£s, the GM can step up the complication for each additional hitch without giving any additional üÖü‚óè. The GM might also roll hitches‚Äîcalled opportunities‚Äîwhich the players can activate. See Hitch for more.

## ROLLING A BOTCH
All the dice roll 1Ô∏è‚É£s. A critical failure. The total is zero. The GM can introduce a 6Ô∏è‚É£ complication without paying a üÖü‚óè and step it up as many times as there are hitches past the first.

## ROLLING AN OPPORTUNITY
When the GM rolls a 1Ô∏è‚É£ on their dice, this hitch is also known as an opportunity. Any player can spend a üÖü‚óè to activate the opportunity to either:
- Step down an existing complication to a smaller size die. A 6Ô∏è‚É£ becomes a 4Ô∏è‚É£, and a 4Ô∏è‚É£ goes away.
- Step up an existing asset‚Äîto a maximum of 1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£‚Äîfor the rest of the scene. Even signature assets can be temporarily stepped up in this way. If the GM‚Äôs dice include multiple 1Ô∏è‚É£s, players may step up or down their asset or complication multiple times and still only pay a single üÖü‚óè per trait affected. See Hitch for more.

## CHOOSING AN EFFECT DIE
The effect die is chosen from the dice pool after the dice used for the total are taken out and added together. Usually the effect die is the largest size of die that wasn‚Äôt used in the total. Only the size of the effect die (number of sides) matters; the result rolled on the effect die has no further use in the roll. See Effect Die for more.

## DIFFICULTY DICE
The difficulty is a measure of how hard it is to succeed, represented by a pair of dice that make up the foundation of an opposition pool. The specific details depend on the situation. See Difficulty for more.

## SCALE DIE
A die added to the dice pool of one side of a conflict if it has a significant size advantage over the other side. See Scale for more.

## DOUBLE A DIE
Doubling a die means adding another die of the same size to the dice pool before the dice are rolled.

## REROLL A DIE
Rolling a die or dice again, ignoring the previous result and using the new result.

## STEP UP OR STEP DOWN A DIE
Occasionally, you‚Äôre asked to swap out one or more dice for bigger or smaller dice. This is called stepping up or stepping down a die rating. To step up a die by one, swap it for a die that‚Äôs one step larger than the original. To step down a die by one, swap it out for a die that‚Äôs one step smaller. Stepping down a 4Ô∏è‚É£ makes it go away. A 1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ has special results when being stepped up, depending on the circumstances:

- In your dice pool, a stepped up 1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ adds an additional 6Ô∏è‚É£
- As an effect die, a stepped up 1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ is an automatic takeout or adds a second effect die
- As a complication or stress, the character is taken out

## HERO DICE
Using this mod, the primary benefit of rolling a heroic success is the creation of hero dice. On a heroic success, you may bank a die equal to the highest rolling die in the opposition pool. These banked dice are called hero dice, which players can use to perform impressive feats. See Heroic Success for more.
