# TAKEN OUT
A character can be taken out of a scene due to the consequences of a roll, or due to their complications overcoming them for that scene. This is alternatively called stressed out when using the stress mod.

When a character is taken out, they may no longer perform any test or contest and no longer participate in the scene. Generally, a character that’s taken out of a scene has no further impact on the scene’s outcome.

## BEING TAKEN OUT
Most tests and contests don’t carry a risk of failure so dire that it takes a PC out of the scene. When they do, it’s called a high stakes scene. It’s up to the GM to make it clear from the beginning when it’s a high stakes scene where failure may mean being taken out. Often the GM presents players with a number of options that include some with this potential outcome, usually with a commensurate greater reward. Players can then decide if the risk is worth it.

A character may be taken out when they:

- Fail to beat their opponent in a high stakes contest and lose, suffering the consequences on their opponent’s terms
- Fail a test in a high stakes scene
- Have a complication or stress die stepped up beyond **d12**.

Instead of being taken out, a player may spend a [[Plot Point]] and take a complication instead. The die rating of the complication is equal to the effect die of the opposition. If the complication comes from something other than a die roll, it begins at a default **d6**.

Similarly, when a GMC loses a contest that would result in them being taken out, the GM may hand over a [[Plot Point]] to the player who won the contest and add a complication to the GMC equal to the effect die in the player’s roll. This should be used rarely, and only when it will drive the story forward.

## RECOVERING IN A SCENE
If a complication attached to a character is somehow stepped up beyond **d12**, that character is automatically taken out of the scene. Complications that are stepped up beyond **d12** are such a significant hindrance that they effectively keep the character from being able to act or play any part in the scene. A complication, even one stepped up above **d12**, lasts until the complication is removed or no longer hinders them.

It’s possible that being taken out of a scene can be reversed by other characters in that scene, if they have healing abilities, magic, or the ability to change the circumstances that took the PC out in the first place. If a PC returns from being taken out, they usually come back with at least a **d6** complication that reflects their traumatic experience.

See [[Complications]] for more.

## TRAUMA MOD
When using the stress mod, you can also choose to include this mod. Trauma is like long-term stress. Using this mod, any time a PC’s stress is stepped up past **d12** and they’re stressed out of the scene they gain **d6** trauma of the same type of stress that just increased. Trauma functions just like stress but is much harder to recover.

During any scene in which a character is stressed out and has taken trauma, additional stress to the character goes directly to trauma. Once trauma is stepped up beyond **d12**, the character is permanently out of options—they’re dead, hopelessly incoherent, lost to their own psyche, or whatever seems most appropriate.
