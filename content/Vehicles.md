# VEHICLES
In some settings, vehicles like spaceships, sailing ships, or RVs need more of a mechanical role than other trait sets can provide. If they’re as important to the story as the characters are, then they deserve more attention.

To make [[Vehicles]] come to life in settings like this, each group of players maintains a [[Vehicles]] file, a bit like a [[Character File]], that contains [[traits]] like attributes, [[distinctions]], and [[Signature Assets]]. Players can use their [[Vehicles]] to accomplish goals such as chasing down criminals or staging attacks on enemy installations.

## USING VEHICLES
PCs make tests or engage in contests using the vehicle’s [[traits]] any time the vehicle’s attributes matter more than the individual PC’s attributes (or equivalent [[trait]]).

[[Vehicles]] [[Dice Pool]] are assembled by pairing one of the vehicle’s attributes with a PC’s other [[traits]], usually a [[trait]] that relates specifically to handling the vehicle in the situation presented by the GM.

Success or failure in vehicle tests typically affects the whole group. If a failed roll leads to the [[Complications]] **Failing Coolant System**, the results of that complication affect everyone on board the vehicle. Be careful not to lay on the costs of failure too quickly, as a single bad roll could potentially knock out the whole group in one hit.

Players can purchase assets with their [[Plot Points]] and acquire [[Complications]] that affect their [[Vehicles]] just as they can for individual characters. Any [[Assets]] purchased by a player for the [[Vehicles]] starts at a **d6** and lasts for a scene, and any [[Hitches]] rolled on a [[Vehicles]] test can be activated by the GM to add [[Complications]] to the vehicle. If the result of a test or contest would take out a [[Vehicles]], any player may spend a [[Plot Point]] for their PC to instead take a [[Complications]] equal to the highest rolling die in the opposing pool to keep the [[Vehicles]] in the fight.

## VEHICLE TRAIT SETS
 In addition to the traits of the vehicle’s pilot, engineer, and other PCs, the vehicle itself possesses several traits that can be added to rolls made when PCs make [[tests]] or [[Contest]]. These [[traits]] sometimes replace (attributes) and sometimes complement or supplement ([[distinctions]] and [[Signature Assets]]) existing PC [[traits]].

### VEHICLE ATTRIBUTES
Primarily, vehicle attributes replace team attributes (or an equivalent trait) when a PC is assembling a [[Dice Pool]] that involves the vehicle. There are three default attributes, which each start at a **d8** die rating. An attribute rating may be stepped up, as long as there is a corresponding step down in another attribute. Vehicle attributes can go up to **d12** or down to **d4**.

The three default attributes are:

- **Engines**: This measures the agility and speed of your [[Vehicles]], including how well it handles and the kind of problems the engine might have. The higher the Engines die rating, the faster and more agile it is. A lower Engines die rating might indicate the vehicle is awkward to maneuver or just plain slow.

- **Frame**: This is the structure that contains the interior of the [[Vehicles]] and keeps everything together. A higher Frame means that your vehicle is strong and secure, while a weaker Frame might indicate perpetual problems with the exterior.

- **Systems**: This helps the [[Vehicles]] operate, including life support, communications, internet access, computers, and navigation. The higher the Systems die rating, the more technically sophisticated the vehicle is. A lower Systems die rating indicates a no-frills vehicle, or one with a lot of hotwired parts.

GM vehicles have a fourth attribute:

- **Crew**: This represents the skill of the crew of a GMC-operated vehicle. A higher Crew die rating indicates trained professionals, while a lower rated Crew is either unskilled or flying with a skeleton team.

### VEHICLE DISTINCTIONS
[[Vehicles]] have vehicle [[distinctions]] with [[SFX]] just like basic character [[distinctions]]. Each vehicle [[distinction]] comes with a Hinder: Gain a [[Plot Point]] when you switch out this distinction’s **d8** for a **d4** [[SFX]], but other [[SFX]] are also unlockable.

[[Vehicles]] distinctions may be added to a [[Dice Pool]] when a character is using the [[Vehicles]] to accomplish a task. A player may add both a [[Vehicles]] [[distinction]] and a personal [[distinction]] to a single [[Dice Pool]].

[[Vehicles]] [[distinctions]] come in three types, and each [[Vehicles]] has one [[distinction]] from each category:

- **Model** determines the [[Vehicles]]’s starting attributes and indicates the vehicle’s base type.
- **History** reveals how old or new the vehicle is. It can also indicate the vehicle’s current use.
- **Customization** reveals how the vehicle has been modified, remodeled, or upgraded since its initial build.

### VEHICLE SIGNATURE ASSETS
Like individual PCs, [[Vehicles]] can have [[Signature Assets]] to add to a [[Dice Pool]]. These [[Assets]] represent modifications or resources that are available on the [[Vehicles]]. Typically, [[Vehicles]] [[Signature Assets]] have a rating of **d8**.

## BUILDING A VEHICLE
[[Vehicles]] are typically built using the scratch built character creation method, though some settings where [[Vehicles]] are more important may offer other options.

Building a [[Vehicles]] follows these steps:

1. Pick a model [[distinction]] and assign a **d8** to each attribute.
2. Step up one attribute by one or two steps, and step down one or both of the attributes by the same total number of steps. Alternatively, keep all attributes at **d8**.
3. Pick a history [[distinction]].
4. Pick a customization [[distinction]].
5. Assign the Hinder [[SFX]] to each [[distinction]].
6. Choose or create two additional [[SFX]] to attach to one or two [[distinctions]].
7. Create two [[Signature Assets]] rated at **d8** representing a special feature or minor GMC.
8. Name the [[Vehicles]], and discuss biographical information.

## TRAINING UP VEHICLES
In games using a [[Growth]] mod, players can spend their [[Growth]] to improve the [[Vehicles]] instead of their individual PC. As with an individual PC, [[Vehicles]] can swap [[distinctions]], add or step up [[Signature Assets]], and unlock new [[SFX]]. It’s impossible for a [[Vehicles]] to swap out its model distinction.

PCs can also spend [[dice]] from their [[Growth]] pool to purchase improvements to the [[Vehicles]].

See [[Growth]] for more.

## RESOURCE POOLS
In this mod for [[Resources]] and [[Vehicles]], each [[Vehicles]] has multiple pools of dice that function as prop resources.

One [[Player]] is assigned the role of tracking [[Resources]] in each mission. Before each mission, this [[Player]], with the advice of the group as a whole, decides how many [[dice]] the [[Resources]] pools contain for that mission. This decision can’t be changed after the mission starts, but the team is given the briefing before any [[dice]] need to be assigned. Each pool starts with **d6**, and the team may assign 7x **d6** among the five pools. No pool may have a rating of more than **d6** **d6** **d6** **d6**.

Any player can spend the [[Resources]] out of each pool, rolling them and adding the highest rolling die to their total for a [[Tests]]. The other rolled [[dice]] are discarded—they do not go back into the [[Resources]] pool. The [[Resources]] in question must align with the [[Tests]] they’re being used for; players who spend the [[dice]] come up with some narrative for what that [[Resources]] is and how it’s being applied.

[[Resources]] must be committed to a specific [[Tests]] before the [[Tests]] is rolled, and once spent out of the pool, they aren’t refreshed until a bridge scene, or until a player adds a **d6** to a crisis pool to refresh one. The latter effect represents a knuckle-biting last-minute airdrop of supplies that may make things worse. Any player may spend [[Resources]] and refresh [[Resources]].

The five example resource pools can be found on the Cortex Prime Game Handbook, page 155.
