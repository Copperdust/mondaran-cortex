# SFX
SFX is short for “special effect.” It’s usually some kind of benefit or bonus that only occurs under certain conditions. In Cortex Prime, SFX are used as a way to introduce exception-based rules for [[Trait Sets]] that possess them. They’re a way to break the rules of the game, modify the outcome of [[tests]] and [[Contest]], and add more texture to the story.

All [[distinctions]] get the Hinder SFX for free, and other [[Trait Sets]] may have one or more SFX to give context to the traits in the set.

• Hinder: Gain a [[Plot Point]] when you switch out this distinction’s **d8** for a **d4**.

## WHEN TO USE SFX
SFX are especially useful when you want to add depth and variety to [[Trait Sets]] or [[Assets]]. In general, you should decide which [[Trait Sets]] in your game features [[SFX]], and use that [[Trait Sets]] as the key area of differences between otherwise similar characters. In games with power sets or pre-set [[distinctions]], [[SFX]] provide ways to further define and shape what those traits actually represent.

Because [[SFX]] are used to break the rules or provide additional ways to earn and spend [[Plot Point]], create [[Assets]], or alter die rolls, they’re a mechanical way to represent special abilities, tricks, or maneuvers your character has knowledge of. [[SFX]] are best when they allow you to differentiate your character from other characters with otherwise similar traits, and to flesh out [[Trait Sets]] that form the core of a character.

When you use [[SFX]] with [[distinctions]], they let you further define what a character with that [[distinction]] can do beyond just getting the **d8** in a [[Dice Pool]]. When you use them with power sets or skills, they allow you to attach fun and interesting tricks to those [[traits]] without having to create narrow or specific traits. And they provide an ideal means of tracking character growth, especially when they’re used in pre-built character archetypes; distinctions can come with three or more SFX that the player can unlock over time and experience.

## COMMON TRAIT SETS FOR SFX
Though you can attach SFX to any trait set, the most common trait sets for using SFX are:

• Abilities
• Distinctions
• Powers
• Power Sets
• Signature Assets

## CREATING SFX
When creating your own, one way to look at [[SFX]] is as a combination of a cost (or a drawback) and a benefit.
Some [[SFX]] may switch out the cost for a different sort of triggering condition. This can include rolling a heroic success, or some roleplaying-based triggering effect.
[[SFX]] often combine both a cost and a triggering condition, especially if the benefit is broader or more potent than usual. In some cases, an [[SFX]] may include a narrative condition that explains when and how it’s used to give context to the SFX.

### BENEFIT
A benefit is the part of an [[SFX]] that provides something helpful. It’s usually paired with a cost.

Here are some standard benefits:
• Earn a [[Plot Point]]
• Add a **d6** to the dice pool
• Step up a beneficial die
• Double a beneficial die
• Step down a non-beneficial die
• Introduce a narrative detail
• Rename a complication
• Reroll a single die
• Create a **d8** asset for the scene (stunt)
### COST
A cost is the part of an SFX that must be paid in order to activate the beneficial part of an SFX.

Here are some standard costs:
• Spend a [[Plot Point]]
• Step down a beneficial die
• Step up a non-beneficial die
• Choose to do something risky
• Create a **d8** complication
• Shut down a trait set

## SIX STANDARD SFX
When creating your own [[SFX]], it’s helpful to look at examples of [[SFX]] such as those on page 191 of the Cortex Prime Game Handbook or page 268 of Tales of Xadia: The Dragon Prince Roleplaying Game.
Here are some standard templates for [[SFX]] that game designer Leonard Balsera uses.

• **The Exchange**: Step up or double one useful die for the scene but step down one other die in exchange until you do a recovery action.
• **The Price**: Step up or double one useful die for the scene or take a **d8** asset for the scene (choose one benefit, not both), but also take a **d8** complication.
• **The Swap**: Spend a [[Plot Point]] to use a different die than would normally be appropriate for a given action, based on your distinction.
• **The Edit**: Spend a [[Plot Point]] to declare a beneficial thing to be true in the fiction, based on your distinction.
• **The Folly**: Earn a [[Plot Point]] when you choose to do something detrimental related to the distinction.
• **The Shutdown**: Earn a [[Plot Point]] when you declare that, due to appropriate circumstances based on your distinction, you have lost access to one or more of your [specific trait] for the scene and cannot use it in any actions.

## SFX DICE TRICKS
Here’s a summary of the dice tricks that [[SFX]] frequently use.

• Stepping up means increasing the size of a die by one step.
• Stepping down means decreasing the size of a die by one step.
• Rerolling means rolling a die or dice again, ignoring the previous result and using the new result.
• Doubling a die means adding another die of the same size to the dice pool before the dice are rolled.

Aside from rerolling, most [[SFX]] tricks affect the unrolled dice in the pool, although SFX that call for stepping up or stepping down an effect die obviously take place after an effect die is chosen.

Good [[SFX]] make it unambiguous when an effect takes place, usually after a specific trigger and before the total is declared or effect dice are put into play.

## AREA ATTACK/EFFECT
Many attacks allow for a special kind of [[SFX]] called an area attack or area effect. At the cost of a [[Plot Point]], the benefit allows the character to add an additional **d6** to the [[Dice Pool]] for each additional target. After the roll, when determining effect dice (stress, [[Complications]], etc.) an additional die may be chosen for every additional **d6** that was added. Area effects are resisted individually by all targets, who roll to set or raise the difficulty against the attacking character’s single total. This [[SFX]] is especially effective against mobs.

## LIMIT MOD
A limit is an [[SFX]] mod that introduces vulnerabilities that provide [[Plot Point]]. Most limits use the shutdown cost with the earn a [[Plot Point]] benefit. With a shutdown cost, there’s always a specific situation in which the character can restore the shutdown trait, even if it’s just “restore the trait at the beginning of the next scene” or something along those lines.

The GM can activate limits in some circumstances by spending a [[Plot Point]] (or a doom pool die, if that mod is used). If the GM chooses to do this, they should first offer the player the option to activate it themselves, in order to gain the [[Plot Point]] benefit. If the player decides not to, the option then goes to the GM, and the [[Plot Point]] the GM spends goes to the pile, not to the player.
