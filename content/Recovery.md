# RECOVERY
Many of the things that hinder PCs ([[Complications]], stress, etc.) go away before the next [[scene]] begins. But those that represent major consequences stick around and require tests to recover.

• **Complications**
• Life Points
• **Being Taken Out**
• Stress
• **Trauma**

## COMPLICATION RECOVERY
 Getting rid of or reducing a [[Complications]] is a [[Tests]] vs a [[Dice Pool]] consisting of the [[Complications]] and a base difficulty of **d8**-**d8**.
 
Other [[traits]] may also affect the roll, and the PC or their circumstances must be capable of improving the situation to make a roll.

*When the test is complete, one of the following happens:*

- If you beat the difficulty and your effect die is greater than the complication, the complication is eliminated.
- If you beat the difficulty and the effect die is equal to or smaller than the complication, the complication is stepped down by one. You can’t try to recover that complication again until time passes.
- If you fail to beat the difficulty, the complication remains as it is.
- If you beat the difficulty but roll a hitch, the GM may hand over a [[Plot Point]] and introduce a new complication related to the one that was just recovered.
- If you fail to beat the difficulty and roll a hitch, the complication is stepped up by one step for every hitch rolled.

## RETURNING FROM BEING TAKEN OUT
If a complication attached to a character is somehow stepped up beyond **d12**, that character is automatically taken out of the scene. Complications that are stepped up beyond **d12** are such a significant hindrance that they effectively keep the character from being able to act or play any part in the scene.

It’s possible that being taken out of a scene can be reversed by other characters in that scene, if they have healing abilities, magic, or the ability to change the circumstances that took the character out in the first place. If a character returns from being taken out, they usually come back with at least a **d6** complication that reflects their traumatic experience.

## TRAUMA RECOVERY
Unlike stress or a complication, trauma does not recover on its own. Recovering trauma is a test vs a dice pool consisting of a base difficulty of **d8** **d8**, plus the stress die. In some games, like Tales of Xadia: The Dragon Prince Roleplaying Game, this test can only be made by another PC.

*When the test is complete, one of the following happens:*

- If you beat the difficulty, the trauma die rating is stepped down by one.
- If you fail to beat the difficulty, the trauma does not get any better or worse. You can’t try to recover that trauma again until time passes.
- If you beat the difficulty but roll a hitch, the GM may hand over a [[Plot Point]] and introduce either a complication that will hinder the PC in the next scene or inflict stress of a different type than the trauma that was being recovered, starting at **d6** (or stepping up by one if the PC already had stress of that type).
- If you fail to beat the difficulty and roll one or more hitches, the trauma gets worse, stepping up by one for each hitch rolled. If this steps the trauma up past **d12**, that’s all, folks.
