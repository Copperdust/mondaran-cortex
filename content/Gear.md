# GEAR
Gear may encompass armor, weapons, handy tools, and more. In Cortex these can be represented using any number of [[traits]] or mechanics. However, gear can also be solely narrative; it’s not always represented by [[traits]]. A piece of gear doesn’t require a die rating associated with it to be a part of the story.

## GEAR AS NARRATIVE
Gear may simply be narrative—part of a character’s physical description that’s mentioned when describing how the character makes an attack, or interacts with the world around them. No die is added to a dice pool when narrative gear is used in this way, but both GMs and players can take inspiration from narrative gear for creating [[Complications]].

Narrative gear can also act as fictional permission to use some [[traits]], such as a Shoot skill that requires a gun or bow to use. Players can spend a [[Plot Point]] to turn a narrative piece of gear into an [[Assets]] for the duration of a [[scene]]. See [[Assets]] for more.

## GEAR AS SIGNATURE ASSETS
Some characters have iconic weapons, tools, or pet robots that contribute to their [[Dice Pool]] in [[tests]] and [[Contest]]. These are signature assets that the character doesn’t have to create during play as they “belong” to the character and act much like any other [[trait]].

See [[Signature Assets]] for more.

## GEAR RANGE MOD
If you want to represent the effect of various distances on ranged weapons (or any other gear with a range), determine if attacking the target with your chosen weapon would be within its standard range, if it’d be a stretch, or if it’d be almost impossible.

Assign a difficulty die to the opposition pool of **d8** if it’s a stretch and a **d12** if it’s almost impossible. You can come up with individual range bands for various weapons if you like, but something simple like this works for most games.

## PROTECTIVE GEAR MOD
Gear that represents armor or protection may prevent damage at the cost of being stepped down afterward. Compare your gear’s die rating to the die rating of the trait the opposition used for the attack.

If your gear die rating is greater than their attack die rating, their [[effect die]] is ignored and you take no effect from the attack.

If your gear die rating is equal to or less than their attack die rating, their [[effect die]] is stepped down by one.

In either case, the die rating of your gear is stepped down by one.
