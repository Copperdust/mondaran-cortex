# SCALE
A conflict might take place between two groups of 
radically different sizes, scale, or degrees of power. As 
GM, you may adjudicate a simple scale advantage as 
being outright impossible (human being tries to punch 
a spaceship) or with a scale die.

A scale die is a bonus **d8** added to whichever side 
has the advantage. Along with a scale die, that side 
**also adds an extra die result into their total for free** 
(the equivalent of spending a [[Plot Point]] on their total). This 
additional die represents a pretty profound advantage.
You could decide to go with a **d8** **d8** scale and keep two 
additional dice for the total, but this is an overwhelming 
advantage. Usually it’s best to make a ruling and move 
on.

As a rule of thumb, when the mismatch is so unfair that 
it would never work for a normal person, but a PC might 
be able to pull it off, that’s the cue to go to the extra dice. 
Players can earn a scale die if they vastly outnumber or 
outgun their opponents, but usually such odds cause 
GMC opposition to simply surrender.

## MULTI-LEVEL SCALE
Using this mod, the scale die may be any size from **d4** 
to **d12**, each step representing an increasingly larger 
target. You can choose to split the scale die into smaller 
dice: a **d12** can become **d10**-**d10** or **d8**-**d8**-**d8** or **d6**-**d6**-**d6**-**d6**. 
The larger scale side still only keeps one additional die 
in their total, rather than an additional die for each 
additional scale die.
