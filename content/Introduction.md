# INTRODUCTION
In Cortex Prime, actions and outcomes are determined by building and rolling Dice Pools. When you take an action, you'll assemble a [[Dice Pool]] using dice that represent your character's relevant [[Values]], [[Roles]], [[Distinctions]], and optionally [[Signature Assets]], [[Specialties]], [[Vehicles]], and further possibly [[Assets]] and [[Complications]].

Once you've gathered your dice, you'll roll them to see how successfully you navigate the challenge at hand. The goal is to beat a target number set by the game moderator for [[Tests]] (not MATCH), or surpass the total of an opposing character's dice pool in [[Contest]]. Usually, two die in the pool are used for the Total, and a third one is designated as the [[Effect Die]], which determines the magnitude of your action's impact.

During this process, [[Plot Points]] become a valuable currency. They can be spent to enhance your rolls, add dice to your pool, or activate special character abilities. They are a tangible representation of your character's potential to affect the story in significant ways.

Rolling a 1 on any die introduces a [[Hitches]], a complication that can hinder your progress or introduce unexpected twists to the story. On the flip side, achieving a [[Heroic Success]]—exceeding the needed total by 5 or more—awards you a [[Hero Dice]], a bonus that can be saved and used later to give your character a crucial advantage when they need it most.

[[Growth]] is tracked through [[Session Records]], allowing players to gradually upgrade their characters session by session.
