# COMPLICATIONS
A [[Complications]] is an unhelpful temporary [[trait]] that the opposition includes in their [[Dice Pool]] to make the opposed roll harder for the character with the [[Complications]]. [[Complications]] should be given descriptive names and a die rating, usually a **d6** to start.

Stress is the most used mod of [[Complications]]. When you see the word stress in a Codex entry, you can often switch it out for the more general [[Complications]]. Likewise, you can often replace [[Complications]] with stress.

## CREATING COMPLICATIONS
When a player rolls a [[Hitches]] (a 1) on any of their dice, the GM can hand over a [[Plot Point]] to create a [[Complications]]. This doesn’t affect the success or failure of the roll—a [[Complications]] means something else has gone wrong, making life difficult.

[[Complications]] start at **d6**, and additional [[Hitches]] in the same roll step up the [[Complications]] without the GM giving the player more [[Plot Point]]. The GM may choose to create multiple [[Complications]] if there is more than one [[Hitches]], but each new [[Complications]] requires handing over a [[Plot Point]]. If the player rolls a **botch**, the GM creates a **d6** [[Complications]] without giving the player a [[Plot Point]], and steps it up for each [[Hitches]] past the first.

[[Complications]] are persistent and last until either the PC has recovered from them, or the [[Complications]] is made irrelevant.

### WORSENING COMPLICATIONS
Whenever a player or the GM has the option to give a character a [[Complications]], they can instead choose to step up an existing [[Complications]], making it worse for the affected character.

Generally, only one [[Complications]] applies to a specific hindrance or problem. To make a [[Complications]] worse, it should be stepped up.

## USING COMPLICATIONS
Whenever a player or the GM is rolling against a character that has a relevant [[Complications]], they may add it to their [[Dice Pool]]. Doing so doesn’t cost anything, and there’s no limit to how many applicable [[Complications]] can be included in a [[Dice Pool]], nor is there a limit on how many [[Complications]] a character can have.

## COMPLICATIONS AS CONSEQUENCE
Outside of [[Hitches]], [[Complications]] can arise as a result of a lost [[Contest]] or failed [[Tests]]. This usually occurs during a high stakes [[scene]]. In either situation, the GM can decide that a player must step up an existing [[Complications]] by one if the existing [[Complications]] is equal to or larger than the die rating of the new [[Complications]].

See also Stress.

### COMPLICATIONS IN A CONTEST
In a [[Contest]] during a high stakes [[scene]], [[Complications]] can represent those times when characters are hurt or suffer a debilitating setback—physical, mental, or social—but the character wants to continue to engage. Instead of being taken out, a player may spend a [[Plot Point]] and take a [[Complications]] instead. The die rating of the [[Complications]] is equal to the effect die of the opposition. If the [[Complications]] comes from something other than a die roll, it begins at a default **d6**.

Similarly, when a GMC loses a [[Contest]] that would result in them being taken out, the GM may hand over a [[Plot Point]] to the player who won the [[Contest]] and add a [[Complications]] to the GMC equal to the [[effect die]] in the player’s roll. This should be used rarely, and only when it will drive the story forward.

### COMPLICATIONS IN A TEST
The GM may rule that a failed [[Tests]] results in a **d6** [[Complications]] of their choice. The player does not receive a [[Plot Point]]. Additionally, if a test is high stakes and a PC is at risk of being taken out of the scene, the player may choose to spend a [[Plot Point]] to take a [[Complications]] instead.

## RECOVERING COMPLICATIONS
Many [[Complications]] are temporary problems that will go away before the next scene begins. [[Complications]] that represent major consequences, however, stick around. To get rid of them, PCs must test their [[traits]] to recover.

Getting rid of or reducing a [[Complications]] is a [[Tests]] vs a [[Dice Pool]] consisting of the [[Complications]] and a base difficulty of **d8** **d8**. The GM may rule that other [[traits]] affect the roll, similar to a standard [[Tests]]. Narratively, to make a roll the PC attempting the [[Tests]] and the circumstances surrounding it must be capable of improving the situation.

When the [[Tests]] is complete, one of the following happens:

- If the PC beat the difficulty and the effect die is greater than the complication, the complication is eliminated.
- If the PC beat the difficulty and the effect die is equal to or smaller than the complication, the complication is stepped down by one. Time must pass before another test can be made to recover the complication.
- If the PC failed to beat the difficulty, the complication remains as it is.
- If the PC beat the difficulty but rolled a hitch, the GM may hand over a [[Plot Point]] and introduce a new complication related to the one that was just recovered.
- If the PC failed to beat the difficulty and rolled a hitch, the complication is stepped up by one step for every hitch rolled.

## STEPPING COMPLICATIONS UP AND DOWN
Complications attached to a character can be stepped up or down throughout play.
Existing complications may be be stepped up:

- For each hitch in a single roll beyond the hitch used to create the **d6** complication
- Instead of creating a new complication
- When a hitch is rolled on a recovery test
- When an SFX instructs you to do so

When a **d12** complication needs to be stepped up, the character is taken out of the scene until the complication is removed or no longer hinders them. The player may overcome this for a single test or contest by spending a [[Plot Point]], but may only keep one die for the total instead of two.

See also Taken Out and Last-Ditch Effort.

Existing complications may be stepped down:

- With a successful recovery test
- By spending a [[Plot Point]] to activate an opportunity
- For each additional opportunity in a single roll
- When an SFX instructs you to do so

If a complication is stepped down to **d4**, the very next time it might affect a character it’s added to that character’s dice pool, rather than the opposition’s dice pool, and the character earns a [[Plot Point]]. Immediately after it’s used this way, it’s stepped down and eliminated—unless the dice come up with one or more hitches, in which case the GM may choose to activate them and step up the complication to **d6** or more.
