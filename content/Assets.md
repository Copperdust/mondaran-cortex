# ASSETS
An [[Assets]] is a [[trait]] you create during play—usually by spending a [[Plot Point]]—that instantly labels a part of the fiction as significant. An [[Assets]] allows you to improve your chance at influencing the story by adding more [[dice]] in a flavorful and thematic way. See [[Complications]] for similar [[traits]] that make things more difficult instead of easier.

Giving an object a die rating by creating an [[Assets]] means that this object is a significant part of the story. Most objects in the game are color, setting, or flavor rather than an [[Assets]]; if it’s something that exists in the story, something the GM or players are using as part of their description, then it should be a part of narrating the outcome of a [[Tests]] or [[Contest]], but it doesn’t confer any more [[dice]].

During play, a player can add as many of their fictionally appropriate [[Assets]] to a [[Dice Pool]] as they’d like. Since they spent a [[Plot Point]] to create the [[Assets]], there’s no need to spend another to use it.

[[Assets]] belong to the character of the player that created them, and by default can’t be included in anyone else’s pool. An [[Assets]] created to help another character belongs to that character and can’t be used by the creator’s character. Spend an additional [[Plot Point]] to declare an [[Assets]] to be open and usable by any character in the scene, including GMCs.

[[Assets]]—also called **temporary assets** when they need to be distinguished from [[Signature Assets]]—last until the end of the [[scene]], unless something in the story makes them no longer relevant, or they’re stepped down or eliminated.
The player may spend an additional [[Plot Point]] to keep the [[Assets]] around through to the end of the [[session]].

Spend a [[Plot Point]] to:
• Create a **d6** [[Assets]]
• Make an [[Assets]] last for the rest of the [[session]]
• Declare an [[Assets]] open to any character in the [[scene]]
• Activate a GM opportunity to step up an [[Assets]] for a [[scene]] (sometimes called spotlighting the asset)

## CREATING ASSETS
There are several ways for [[Player]] to create [[Assets]] during play:

• A player can spend a [[Plot Point]] and create a **d6** [[Assets]] with a name they come up with.
• Some [[SFX]] allow for stunts—[[Assets]] that start with a **d8** die rating.
• A player can create an [[Assets]] greater than **d6** and without spending a [[Plot Point]] by making a [[Tests]].
• When the narrative situation calls for it, the GM may declare that a **d6** [[Assets]] is created for free as part of a successful [[Tests]] that wasn’t made explicitly to create an [[Assets]].

### TEST-CREATED ASSETS
To create an [[Assets]] by attempting a [[Tests]], a player declares what their character does to create the [[Assets]] and assembles an appropriate [[Dice Pool]]. The GM rolls to set the [[Difficulty]], usually with something basic like **d6**-**d6**. The effect die of the [[Tests]] becomes the die rating of the [[Assets]]. The GM may set a cap on the size of [[Assets]] created this way by setting the difficulty [[dice]] to that die rating. The [[Assets]] created may not be larger than this die cap.

### CLUES AS ASSETS
Anytime a PC wants to get a read on somebody, case a [[scene]], spot something out of the ordinary, or generally just use their senses, they’re creating an [[Assets]].
The GM usually calls for the roll, though it’s just as valid for a player to ask for it. The difficulty for an [[Assets]] [[Tests]] is set by rolling a straight **d6**-**d6**—unless the GM decides otherwise. A player’s [[Dice Pool]] for the [[Tests]] is assembled from appropriate [[traits]].

With a successful [[Tests]], the PC gains some crucial information. If the PC spends a [[Plot Point]] after succeeding at the [[Tests]], they can bank the [[Assets]] until they need it, give it to another character, or keep it for longer.

With a failed [[Tests]], the PC doesn’t gain any useful advantage. If there are [[Complications]], they generally represent the consequences of poking around places trying to find stuff out.

## ASSET VS SIGNATURE ASSET
Unlike a regular [[Assets]], a [[Signature Assets]] belongs to a PC and is recorded on their [[Character File]]. It acts like any other [[trait]] and gives the player an extra die to include in their [[Dice Pool]] when they can justify their use.
