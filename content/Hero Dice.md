## HERO DICE
The primary benefit of a heroic success is the creation of [[Hero Dice]]. On a [[heroic success]], you may bank a die equal to the highest rolling die in the 
opposing [[Dice Pool]]. These banked dice are called hero dice, and players may save as many of them as they like. There’s a space on the character file to indicate how many hero dice you’ve earned and what size they are.

To use a hero die, you spend a [[Plot Point]] and roll the die, adding it to your total in any [[Tests]] or [[Contest]]. You may do this at any time after rolling the dice to get a total, even if you rolled first and the opposition has already rolled their own dice. It must be done before the outcome of the roll is decided. You might be so successful that you get another [[heroic success]] and earn another hero die. Whatever happens, erase the hero die you used from your [[Character File]].

Hero dice can backfire. If the die comes up 1—a [[Hitches]]— the GM may introduce a [[Complications]] as if you had rolled a 1 on any other die. However, instead of 
accepting a [[Plot Point]] from the GM, you may choose to take back your hero die and not add it to your total. You still lose the [[Plot Point]] you spent to activate it.

Hero dice require [[Plot Point|Plot Points]] to activate them because adding dice after you roll your [[Tests]] or [[Contest]] is a powerful advantage. This is one of the few cases in Cortex Prime where you have the ability to roll more dice to add to your total after you’ve rolled your [[Dice Pool]]. Hero dice don’t stick around after they’re used for a roll. During a [[Contest]], if your opponent beats your total even after you added a hero die to it, you can’t use the same hero die on your next roll.

## RESOURCES VS HERO DICE
[[Resources]] and hero dice are both expendable. [[Resources]] dice are more helpful than hero dice because they don’t require Ⓟ● to activate them, but the downside is that they can only be used in specific circumstances, represented by that [[Resources]]’s tag. Hero dice can be used on any [[Tests]] or [[Contest]], regardless of the nature of that [[Tests]] or [[Contest]].
