# SESSION RECORDS
With this mod, at the end of each session, the players make a note of the session’s name on their character file. This is the PC’s personal session record, and over time it provides an account of the group’s accomplishments and checkered past.

Players can then use the session record to their benefit in play as a callback to do anything they would normally spend a [[Plot Point]] to do, or they can spend sessions from their record in exchange for making permanent improvements to their character file.

## CALLBACKS
Each player may use their own session record to make callbacks, references to events from other sessions that may be useful towards the current storyline.

To make a callback, have your PC make an in-character reference to a session in their session record while performing a task. When you use a callback, you may gain a benefit immediately for anything that a [[Plot Point]] could be used for.

You can only make a callback to a specific session once per session. A checkbox next to each session is useful for this purpose. Erase checked boxes when a new session begins and add the last session’s name to the record.

### FLASHBACK SCENES WITH CALLBACKS
When making a callback, you or the GM might decide to start a flashback scene. Flashback scenes serve the primary purpose of filling in some backstory that the group wants to bring up in the current scene. A flashback scene can interrupt another type of scene, but it shouldn’t be drawn out, since flashback scenes often involve only one or two PCs and the GM.

## TRAINING UP
By spending sessions from your record, you can make permanent improvements to your PC. A spent session remains on the record but can no longer be used for callbacks or to train a second time.

Training can happen any time during downtime between sessions. Maximum die ratings of **d12** apply in all cases. If you switch out a distinction, your new distinction has as many SFX unlocked as the original, although they may be entirely different SFX.

The following standard improvements are usually available when using this mod:

**1 session**
- Turn an asset from a session into a signature asset (or relationship):
- Switch out a distinction (or trait statement) for a new one

**2 sessions**
- Step up a signature asset (or relationship):
- Add a new specialty
- Unlock a new SFX

**3 sessions**
- Step up a skill (or resource, role, value, or power)

**4 sessions**
- Step up one attribute (or affiliation) and step down another

A setting may have its own unique menu of options for training up characters with sessions from the record that differ from the standard. See Hammerheads in the Cortex Prime Game Handbook (page 156) for an example.
