# PLOT POINTS
Cortex Prime games run on a narrative currency called plot points (Ⓟ●) that influence the plot. They’re the fuel for the system’s engine. The cycle of earning, spending, and then earning more plot points is something that you must maintain when deciding what mods to use.

## PLAYER PLOT POINTS
Plot points (Ⓟ●) are a way for players to affect the plot beyond the roll of the dice. Plot points can be spent to give players more dice, make the dice they have more powerful, or activate certain traits or special effects (SFX) on a character file. 

You need a way to keep track of Ⓟ●. You can write them as tally marks on your character file or use poker chips or some other kind of token.

Every player starts a game session with at least one Ⓟ●. Unspent Ⓟ● are carried over from session to session, but it’s best to spend Ⓟ● when the opportunity arises—it’s not hard to get more during play.

The following are the standard ways to earn and spend Ⓟ● as a player.

### Earning
• Roll a hitch (a 1) that the GM activates
• Give in during a contest
• Activate an SFX like Hinder
• Engage in remarkable moments of roleplaying
### Spending
• Activate SFX
• Add two dice from a [[Trait Sets]] instead of one
• Activate an Opportunity (a 1) that the GM rolls
• Avoid being [[Taken Out]]
• Create a ⑥ [[Assets]] for the scene, or to keep an [[Assets]] for the rest of the session
• Include an additional result in your total
• Interfere in a contest
• Keep an extra effect die
• Share an [[Assets]] with everyone in a scene

## GM PLOT POINTS
Unless mods are applied, the GM has two pools of Ⓟ●: the bank and the pile.

### THE BANK
At the start of each session, the GM gets a Ⓟ● per player in the game added to the bank, which they can spend on GMCs and influencing the story. The same bank of Ⓟ● is shared by all of the GMCs in play; they don’t each keep track of their own plot points. When the GM spends these Ⓟ●, they go to the pile instead of to the player who was affected by the roll, just as if a PC had spent the Ⓟ● on the roll. The GM can add more ●Ⓟ to the bank by activating GMC SFX, including using distinctions as a ④ instead of a ⑧.

These can be spent to:
• Include more results in a total
• Activate SFX
• Avoid a GMC being taken out

In general, the GM should strive to spend these Ⓟ● when it makes the story more interesting, and not to target their players.

### THE PILE
In addition to the limited pool of points set aside in the bank, the GM has an unlimited number of Ⓟ● to give to the players when appropriate. The GM uses this pool to purchase complications when the players roll hitches or to hand over Ⓟ● to the players when an SFX calls for it. It’s called the pile because if you’re using physical tokens to keep track of them, it’s best to just make a big 
pile of those tokens in the middle of the table. Most of the time, when players or the GM spend Ⓟ●, they return to this pile.

## PLOT POINT MODS
These rules alter the way the plot point flow works in 
the game, including how they’re spent and tracked by 
players and GMs.

### NO BANK
With this mod, the GM doesn’t have a private supply of Ⓟ●. When the players spend Ⓟ●, they go into the big pile in the middle of the table, in front of the GM. When the GM spends Ⓟ● in a roll against a player, they slide a Ⓟ● from the pile to that player.

Players can’t use Ⓟ● they just earned when the GMCs spent the Ⓟ● to improve their current rolls or activate SFX, so they should keep those ●Ⓟ separate until the end of the current roll.

Using this mod, a major GMC can’t earn a Ⓟ● when a distinction is used as a ④, so the GM can bank a ⑥ for that character and drop it into a future action as needed. There’s no limit to how many of these dice a major GMC can save up, but regardless of how many are used on a roll, the GM may still only use two dice for a total.
