# DIFFICULTY
Difficulty is a measure of how hard it is to succeed at something, typically represented by a pair of dice that make up the foundation of an opposition pool. The specific details depend on the situation. Most difficulties are a variation of a [[Tests]] difficulty.

For a [[Tests]], the GM assembles an opposition pool and rolls it, setting the difficulty by adding together two dice from the roll and announcing the total. That difficulty is the number the player needs to beat with their own total when they roll their dice for the test.

If they beat it, the test is a success. If they didn’t beat it, the test is a failure. Beating a difficulty means rolling higher than the difficulty total. If the player’s total is the same as the difficulty’s total, they didn’t beat it, so this still counts as a failure. The difficulty dice are always two dice of the same number of sides, based on the situation.

| Difficulty  | Base Dice |
| ----------- | --------- |
| VERY EASY   | d4-d4     |
| EASY        | d6-d6     |
| CHALLENGING | d8-d8     |
| HARD        | d10-d10   |
| VERY HARD   | d12-d12   |

In addition to difficulty dice, the GM picks up one or more dice based on appropriate traits from the location, opposing GMCs, or the scene itself. The GM can also add one or more d6 to represent increasing risks or threats.
