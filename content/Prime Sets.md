# PRIME SET
A prime set is one of at least two [[Trait Sets]], in addition to [[distinctions]], that serve as the core of any Cortex Prime character. There are no predefined prime sets, because the [[Trait Sets]] you use in your game are up to you and the decisions you make with your group.

Prime sets provide the baseline dice for your [[Dice Pool]] on any [[Tests]] or [[Contest]]; they’re the dice you reach for when you want to do something. Each trait in these 
sets should have a die rating. If no die rating is noted, it typically defaults to a **d4**.

Note that [[distinctions]] are always a prime set for Cortex Prime games, even if they’re not fully loaded with [[SFX]] or other features.

Prime sets can be expanded by adding [[SFX]] or trait statements to them. This is especially common with powers, but it also makes attributes, [[roles]], and 
relationships more interesting. Do this if you want a specific prime set to carry more story weight in the game through description or deeper definition.
Keep in mind that if you add [[SFX]] or statements to a prime set, you shouldn’t include them with more than one other trait set in the game. Having your 
relationships and [[Values]] use trait statements is fine, but don’t also include trait statements for powers and skills. Similarly, if your powers and [[distinctions]] each 
have [[SFX]], your relationships and [[Values]] shouldn’t. Two sets with trait statements and two sets with [[SFX]]? Fine.

## IN OUR GAME
We use the following Prime Set traits in our game:

- [[Distinctions]]
- [[Values]]
- [[Roles]]
