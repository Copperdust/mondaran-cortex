# VALUES
Values represent how much specific things matter to the PC and, in turn, how much they influence the outcome of [[tests]] and [[Contest]]. They can embody such things as societal mores, cultural principles, or elements of a code of honor or behavior. As with relationships, a high rating in a value doesn’t mean your character likes or stands out as a paragon of that value, but rather that they are more invested and concerned about that value than if they had it at a lower die rating. A **d10** in Truth could still mean the character is a liar, but the concept of truth and falsehood is one of the things that drives them the most to succeed.

## USING VALUES
Values are useful in games where differences in physical or mental attributes matter less to a character than what they’re motivated by and what they believe. Prime time drama, YA stories, political drama, and other personality-driven and emotion-driven genres are all excellent candidates for the values trait set.

## RATING VALUES
Values have a range of die ratings: usually one at **d10**, one or two at **d8**, one at **d4**, and the rest at **d6**. When a value changes—either stepping up or stepping down by a die size—one other value must change at the same time in the opposite direction. Thus, the total number of die steps in the dice assigned to values in any given Cortex Prime game should always stay the same. Values can never be lower than **d4** or higher than **d12**.

The die rating of a value measures how much the value matters to the character, as follows:

- **d4** I’m really not into this.
- **d6** Sure, this matters. But so do a lot of things.
- **d8** This is definitely on my radar.
- **d10** I’m all over this thing.
- **d12** This is my heart and soul.

Values are commonly paired with trait statements to let players further define how their PC feels about each value.

See Statements for more.

## MORAL SUPPORT
On another player’s turn in a challenge, or when they’re in a contest, you can step down one of your value die ratings by one in order to step up that same value in their own dice pool for that roll. Your value remains stepped down until the end of the session.
