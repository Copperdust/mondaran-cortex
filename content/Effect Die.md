# EFFECT DIE
An effect die represents the impact of a success, and might be used in many different ways depending on the context. The effect die is chosen from the dice pool after the dice used for the total are taken out and added together. Usually the effect die is the largest size of die that wasn’t used in the total. Only the size of the effect die (number of sides) matters; the result rolled on the effect die has no further use in the roll.

## INELIGIBLE DICE
You can’t choose a die that produced a hitch for an effect die. If you spend Ⓟ● to add more dice to a total beyond the first two, those dice also can’t also be used as effect dice. If there are no dice left in the pool once the total is determined (or the remaining dice are hitches or otherwise spoken for), the effect die is always a 4️⃣.

## EFFECT DICE IN OPPOSITION
If you win a roll an opposed roll against another character, such as a contest or an action taken during the action order, you compare your effect die against the opposition’s effect die (from the roll they made to try to beat you). If your opponent’s effect die is bigger than yours, your effect die is stepped down by one before you use it for a complication (or stress). If it’s equal to or less than yours, it doesn’t change your effect die.

## EFFECT DICE IN TESTS
When rolling dice for tests, the effect die serves as a useful indicator for the scope of the action’s outcome. A 1️⃣2️⃣ effect die means the test had a mind-blowing outcome, while a 4️⃣ means it was marginal at best. There’s usually no need to compare your effect die with the opposition’s effect die. When you roll to create an asset using a test, your effect die will usually be the rating of the new asset.

## USING EFFECT DICE
The effect die is used for things like determining the size of an asset or complication, or (if you’re using the mod) stress. You won’t always need an effect die, especially when you’re only concerned with pass/fail outcomes.

## ADDING EXTRA EFFECT DICE
You can spend a Ⓟ● to keep an additional effect die. This is used to represent doing multiple things with a single roll. Additional effect dice can be used for different things, such as inflicting other types of complications or creating assets. If you have a heroic success with an 1️⃣2️⃣ effect die, you can add an extra effect die. Either choose a second effect die from unused dice, or start with a 6️⃣ as your second effect die.****
