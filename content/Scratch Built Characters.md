# SCRATCH BUILT CHARACTERS
One method of character creation has players build their own characters completely from the ground up, rather than use partially created character files (like archetypes) or use a guided world creation with the group (like pathways). This is referred to as scratch built.

Each step of scratch built character creation depends on that setting’s [[Prime Sets]] and other [[Trait Sets]], as well as any additional mods that the Cortex game setting is using. The suggested die ratings provided in each trait within the Cortex Codex can be used as a guideline for scratch built characters.

One example of scratch built character creation using attributes, [[distinctions]] and skills as [[Prime Sets]], and [[specialties]] and [[Signature Assets]] as additional traits can be found in the Cortex Prime Game Handbook, pages 70-71.

After assigning all [[traits]], die ratings, [[distinctions]], [[SFX]], and statements based on the requirements of the setting, all scratch built characters conclude with the final stage: biographical information.

Answer these questions as if answering as your character:

- **Your Name**: Pick a favorite name or use an online name generator.
- **Your Pronouns**: What pronouns do you use?
- **Background**: Where were you born? Where did you grow up? What is your family like?
- **Appearance**: Got a telltale birthmark? Blonde hair? Tall and stout? Short and thin? 

To further flesh out your character background, look at the [[distinctions]] you’ve chosen and think about:

- Where you’ve been the last few years.
- Where you’re going in the near future.
- What you’re doing to keep your head above water.
- How you feel about the politics of the world.
