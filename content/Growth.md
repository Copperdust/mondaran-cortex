# GROWTH
While PCs start out as competent, experienced professionals, they can change and grow during play, with each job they take giving them more to grow on. The more adventures the group undertakes, the more benefits they can enjoy and the richer their backstory becomes.

All methods of growing characters are mods. You can play many games of Cortex Prime without growth of any sort outside of the kind that happens in the story or fiction. Many Cortex Prime characters are just fine as they are for several sessions, and if you’re doing a one-shot or limited session story, you won’t worry much about growth either. However, many players love to change things about their characters, so you should—as a group—decide how you want growth to work in your Cortex Prime game.

## SESSION RECORD MOD
With this mod, at the end of each session, the players make a note of the session’s name on their character file. This is the PC’s personal session record, and over time it provides an account of the group’s accomplishments and checkered past.
Players can then use the session record to their benefit in play as a callback to do anything they would normally spend a [[Plot Point]] to do, or they can spend sessions from their record in exchange for making permanent improvements to their character file.
